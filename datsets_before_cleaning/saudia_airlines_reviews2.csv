3,saudia_airlines,Worst customer service ,"Flight Number SV551, from JED to DXB. I would like to bring to your attention the various issues my friend and I encountered during this flight.Upon reaching the check-in counter, I experienced a considerable delay in obtaining my boarding pass due to customers taking an extended amount of time to address baggage weight and contents. The ground staff, during this time, engaged in unprofessional behaviour by laughing and joking amongst themselves, disregarding the inconvenience faced by the waiting customers.Accompanying me was my friend, who required wheelchair assistance due to a fractured ankle. Contrary to usual procedures at other airports, Saudi Airlines required us to proceed to gate 1 to request a wheelchair from customer service. This unexpected deviation from standard protocol contributed to further delays. Despite the challenges posed by the fractured ankle, we rushed to reach the boarding gate (13A), which was the last call for boarding, only to be met with a supervisor displaying extreme rudeness, arrogance, and disrespect towards us.Moreover, at the baggage claim area, we were made to wait for an extended period of 50 minutes before being informed that our baggage had not been offloaded and was still on the flight. To exacerbate the situation, the assistance provided by various customer service agents yielded inconsistent and conflicting information, leaving us without proper guidance or assistance throughout the process.I am profoundly disappointed with the overall service provided by Saudi Airlines during this flight. The lack of professionalism, disregard for passengers' needs, and inadequate communication are unacceptable and reflect poorly on the airline's reputation. This was my first and last flight with Saudi Airlines.","October 2, 2023",1,Date of travel: October 2023,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
4,saudia_airlines,Dissatisfaction and unprofessionalism from Saudia Airlines,"I am writing this about my experience regarding a highly distressing incident that occurred during my recent travel experience with Saudia Airline on 29th September and flight number SV598 .I believe it is essential to bring this matter to your attention to ensure that such incidents are thoroughly investigated and appropriate actions are taken.On 29th September 2023, my family and I were scheduled to depart on the above-mentioned flight from Jeddah Airport to Dubai. We arrived at the gate well in advance, approximately 25 minutes before the scheduled departure time, which should have allowed us plenty of time to board the flight. However, the events that unfolded at the gate were both bewildering and deeply disappointing.At the time of boarding, my father and my younger brother were at the prayer hall within the airport while I had went to call them, while my mother, sister, elder brother,were present at the boarding gate. We were well within the airline's required boarding time frame, with approximately 5 minutes to spare.However, during this brief window, the gate manager displayed a complete lack of professionalism and customer service. Instead of exercising patience for the remaining members of our family to arrive, he began shouting at my mother and insisted that we exit the aircraft immediately. He even threatened to call security to forcibly remove us from the flight.Despite the fact that three of our family members were already on gate, the gate manager's actions resulted in all of us being deboarded from the flight. This not only caused significant distress but also led to us missing our flight entirely.It is important to emphasize that my mother was unwell and not in the best condition during this ordeal. The treatment we received at the hands of your staff was not only unjust but also deeply concerning from a customer service perspective.We approached the station manager of Saudi Airlines at Jeddah Airport to address our dissatisfaction and seek assistance. Regrettably, he displayed a dismissive attitude, refused to take responsibility, and advised us to file a complaint online.This incident has left us profoundly dissatisfied with the level of service and professionalism demonstrated by your airline's staff. We firmly believe that the behavior and actions of the gate manager were unjustified and unbecoming of any airline's standards.We kindly request a thorough investigation into this incident and appropriate measures to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in the future. We also seek a response from your airline regarding the steps taken to address this matter.Please consider this letter as an official complaint, and we look forward to your prompt and satisfactory resolution of this matter. We trust that your airline will take the necessary steps to maintain the high standards of customer service and expect proper compensation for this ordeal and distress.Sincerely,Mustaq +971 ","September 30, 2023",1,Date of travel: August 2023,,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

9,saudia_airlines,Exceptional service! Thank you Huda,"Was pleasantly surprised by Saudi Airlines. Travelled from Bham UK to Jeddah Saudi to Islamabad Pakistan. Service from staff on all flights was exceptional, facilities on the newer and bigger aircrafts was also impressive, from the entertainment to having plug chargers in the chairs. Also the snacks and meals, as well as the prayer room facility on board. Children also given little gifts on the flight and staff are very accommodating, you are provided with headphones, pillow and blanket during the flight. The smaller planes have less facilities and some of the entertainment did not work, you also had to request for items like pillows and Blankets and they were limited. In total during this trip I travelled on 4 Saudi Airline planes as I had to take connecting flights. My 3rd flight from Islamabad to Jeddah, I fell incredibly sick on the flight due to food poisoning from the country I travelled from. The staff were exceptional, specifically Huda the air hostess on the flight, she went above and beyond to help me on the flight, they also made an announcement for a Doctor, who looked after me during the flight. The flight was 6 hours and they treatment me with the upmost compassion and kindness. I will always feel indebted to them for taking care of me during such an awful time. I can't thank you enough.I believe I would use Saudi Airlines again as I had a great experience with them.","September 29, 2023",5,Date of travel: September 2023,,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
10,saudia_airlines,0/100 Most Frustrating journey ever,I will never ever recommend SAUDIA AIRLINES. I will given 0/100 no doubt. Very poor service and it’s really frustrating journey for us. Departure time was 2:55 but flight departures late at 5:10. But we entered into flight at 15:00 we just ask for water but they refused to given they told us they will only serve water when they started serving food.They served water after three hours they didn’t considered as a human being. Water is essential for human being especially it’s a long journey.It’s really awful I think. So rude behaviour. Another thing is I already booked for extra luggage and paid INR 16900/£169 but in check in counter they refused simply and they said it’s not updated in their system.They just wasted our 2 hours to sort it out at last they said they can’t allow the baggage then we paid again for the baggage in the check in counter.It’s too frustrating things they are doing and really rude behaviour. Please do think 100 times before booking SAUDIA AIRLINES ,"September 28, 2023",1,Date of travel: July 2023,,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
11,saudia_airlines,Highly recommend,We can only speak from personal experience but we found Saudi Airlines to offer exceptional service on the 4 flights we took with them this month from Manchester-Jeddah-Kuala Lumpur and back again. On two legs we had the added comfort of a 787-10 plane but even on the older 787-9 older dream-liners we had plenty of legroom and seat comfort. Cabin staff were excellent on all 4 journeys and nothing was too much trouble for them. We had no delays or problems with the luggage. The flight prices were excellent and we would have no hesitation in using them again or recommending them. ,"September 28, 2023",5,Date of travel: September 2023,United Kingdom,5,5,5,4,5,3,5,5
12,saudia_airlines,Lost baggage and worst service from Saudia Airlines ,"My brother and his wife began their honeymoon with Saudia Airlines from Mumbai to Amsterdam, but it turned into a nightmare. Two of their bags disappeared, and they reported it immediately. However, the airline's response was a never-ending loop of disappointment.Every day during their trip, they visited the airport, only to be told that their bag was on T2 and would take 24 hours to arrive on T1, followed by a promise of prompt delivery. Yet, each time they called, the story changed - ""Sorry, sir, it's still in France,"" or ""Sorry, sir, we haven't received it.""I would strongly advise against choosing Saudia Airlines. Think carefully before booking with them. This experience was nothing short of a disaster, and it's evident that their baggage handling and customer service need serious improvement. Their ineptitude cast a shadow over what should have been a special honeymoon.","September 28, 2023",1,Date of travel: September 2023,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

14,saudia_airlines,Avoid Saudia at any cost,"The worst flight experience of my life.Where to start, dropping the bag took 15min and that was only the start.We got on the plane on time. After about 30min we were told of a technical problem needed fixing. After another 30min we were asked to leave the plane and wait at the gate. We kept waiting for more than 2 hours and no UPDATE.It was crazy with the 4-5 Saudia's Thai staff shared no information what so ever!!!We were served a small box of water, a chocolate bar and 2 pieces of patesry.Searching online showed the flight was cancelled! However the staff were talking to each other in Thai and not sharing any information with passengers.After another hours in chaotic manner we were asked to go out and collect our bags before going to a hotel!Again there was no information of where to collect the bags and to which hotel.Passengers were scrambling for any information and we kept moved from one bag rail to another.After another 2 hours now it is almost 11.00pm the bags arrived.At this stage most of the Saudia’s ground team disappeared.The remaining one asked us to go outside the terminal to the bus. Leaving the terminal the remaining Saudia's staff disappeared!!It was chaos till I managed to find a bus that took me to a hotel called O2 luxurious! There is nothing luxurious about this hotel.The staff at the hotel were rude. I was allocated a room full of 🐜. After complaining a second room was given to me.By now it was after midnight. Some passengers were still arriving is such disorganised matter!Day Two: So far no information about a replacement flight time or day.No one from Saudia is answering to messages or on FB and twitter.I can see tontine the flight is now scheduled to 11.00pm but not sure if it will happen.

15,saudia_airlines,The worst travelling experience of my life - avoid them like the plague!,"This has to be the worst airline I have flown with and I will never book tickets with them ever again. My first connecting flight from Cochin was delayed by 4 hours which meant that I missed my connection flight from Riyadh to London(keep in mind that both these flights are Saudia flights). When we reached the Riyadh airport, they made us wait at the airport for 30 hours and refused to provide us with accommodation. They even denied us food and water and we had to fight the airport staff for it. I will never use this airline again even if they offer to fly me for free. Sitting at that airport for 30 hours not been able to sleep because of their bad chairs is one of the worst travelling experiences of my life and I recommend anyone wishing to book with them to steer clear. Ignore any positive reviews that you may see because if no problems arise, the experiences tend to be positive but if anything happens, Saudia treats their customers like farm animals and I would not want to take that risk ever again.","September 27, 2023",1,Date of travel: September 2023,,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1

My bags are still under tracing and missing although its claimed by the rep on the day it would be brought on the next flight. They said that so we would leave. Now reading so many reviews on lost luggage I wish I was more alert. Online tracing system does not even give accurate description that i wrote on the forms. I have medical supplies and actual medication in the baggages. I also have dates in there which would rot bu the time i get my bags. They simply do no care about the customers. I can see after months people have not got their stuff. I am hoping for a miracle at this point. It is really bad that we came from a pilgrimage, a holy thing to do and for people in Saudi to treat clients this way. Do NOT EVER FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE. They WILL lose your luggage for sure. Even the zamzam water. The rep at Gatwick was rude himself and said whatever he could to make us leave. No claim number or anything. Whatsapp communication is hopeless too.

23,saudia_airlines,Wont fly again,"So we flew to and from Gatwick to Saudi Arabia. Out flight going was okay. Check in was easy. Parents had wheelchair access but still had to walk to the plane for a long time. We had seats in the row in-front not being used so we managed to stretch our legs. Prayer rooms were convenient. Food was ravioli pasta, cake slice, corn and bread roll the pasta does not cater to all people on the plane. There was no option to preselect either. They gave fruits and juices throughout the journey. Warm cloths And amenities such as sleeping mask, toothbrush and mini toothpaste. The air stewardess were good. Airport immigration ladies need to get off their high horse and stop talking in a patronising tone. Kept saying habibi in a condescending tone when fingerprints were not working. Like we want to stand there any longer. They barely speak english and looked down on whoever cant speak arabic. Like its an airport with foreign people coming through. Now our journey back was another issue. The check in was long due to staff not knowing passport information. They kept asking my parents for another passport even though i kept explaining that they have a bangladesh passport with indefinite leave. Said they have a resident permit. They looked so confused. I said we entered did we not? Why is it so hard to process? They gave up on running fingerprints and kept huffing and puffing. They were so confused that I owned a British passport and parents didnt like no immigrants have kids? We got wheeled to the front of the gate. We had a domestic flight at 5am and the flight boarded and we were lacking sleep. The main flight gave hot tissues and free drinks again. Breakfast was given rather late but it was either omelette with potato and mushrooms, yoghurt, croissant and fruit bowl or foul with rice but the guy kept saying fool. We opted for the eggs. The airport was really cold with air con everywhere. The transfer was easy too but upon arriving we stood for over an hour staring at luggages. Only one bottle of zamzam water came through which we bout from MEDINA. So it was transferred but not the rest. We went to a rep who stated Jeddah, Manchester and Birmingham did not send over 400 bags as the belt broke at the airport. They only notified gatwick when we arrived and that too hours after waiting. Most transferred flight had no baggage's come through. We filled a report given by a very annoyed rep but he had to understand our frustration after a long journey. They said it may come on a flight today (a day later) and will be sent to our addresses. Lets see what happens as we have valuables and medications in the luggage. No one was available to speak to us at departures desk as they knew there was issues. Jeddah airport was just not giving a toss about bags. Going to jeddah was fine and receiving bags was fine. Just our flight back was shambles. Long queues to check in and departure gate so far. As parents had wheelchair assistance we were brought to the gate very and no time to explore and shop as the assistants just wanted to plant them somewhere.No info on luggage yet so will update. But with this experience i would not fly again as there was no communication was being done to save us a few hours of waiting for luggages. Stick to a more known airline who are more professional in dealing with these matters. The lost properties dont deal with this airline so was an issue.

We had a short 2 hour stopover in Jeddah and the new Airport is amazing and comparable to Dubai Airport or any great International Airport. In short, Saudi Airline Economy has the same standard of service as other airlines in Business class except the seat cannot recline to a flat bed. Leg room is plenty, we get nice amenity bag including toothbrush and toothpaste, drinks (Juice-no alcohol) before take off, plenty of in flight entertainment, power plugs etc. and the service throughout the flight by the crew was constant charming and excellent. Prices are also reasonable especially nowadays! On our return to Bangkok we flew from Geneva to Bangkok with a 3 hour stopover in Jeddah and stayed in the Airline Lounge with plenty of good food and drinks. The Saudi staff at Geneva Airport were exceptionally great as we had a small issue that they helped to resolve most efficiently. For this we thank them very much!

I guessed they intentionally gave the worst plane from Dhaka to Riyadh as Bangladesh is a poor country and most of the passengers is poor migrants so they give them worse plane because they know this poor migrants workers will not complaint anyway.

39,saudia_airlines,Saudia has to stick to their USP of cheap flights to keep their customers,"Saudia Airlines is OK. It's a low cost airline, so you get a low cost journey. There were both good and bad things about the grand total of four flights that I had. The 1st flight from Amsterdam to Jeddah was significantly higher standard than the flight from Jeddah to Jakarta. Entertainment system worked but was limited in its choices and only had Arabic subtitles. The plane was clean and the service was decent. There was also an outlet which was nice. I considered the first flight of good quality and very comfortable for the price I paid. Solid pass.The 2nd flight was not very good. The toilets were beyond disgusting only 3 out of ten hours into the flight. There was only one choice of dinner which were beans (probably because the other choices of food were finished so quickly). There was no outlet and the entertainment system had ""technical issues"". Funnily enough, I flew with Saudia again three weeks later and the entertainment system was still out of order. For a ten hour flight they only served a full meal once (which was breakfast). About 7-8 hours later they only came again with a light snack which was maybe an hour before landing. People bring a disgusting amount of luggage and they place it above your seat, leaving you with no space for your own luggage. One of the staff said they will place my luggage somewhere near the back, but I refused as I had valuables in my suitcase and for principles' sake. After some back and forth, they had to shift the luggage that was above my seat to another spot which was nearly impossible considering how many suitcases the passengers were allowed to bring.Safety protocol was somewhat questionnable at times. People were standing up while the plane was still moving when it landed at the airport. People had bags under their seats during takeoff and landing. Both of these instances show a breach of Saudia's safety protocol. Now after tons of nagging on my end.. some other positive notes. Saudia, in my experience, was punctual. No delays after having taken four different trips. The food was nice in the end. Most of the staff were cordial and polite. The legroom was decent, but maybe that's because I am a manlet. The staff also wasn't difficult when requesting for an extra cup of Joe or some water, which is a very positive note!In summary: Saudia has cheap prices for its flight, but keep in mind you don't get much more than being brought from point A to point B. Maybe that's how it should be for a low- cost airline in the end. 3 out of 5 stars.","August 30, 2023",3,Date of travel: August 2023,"Nijkerk, The Netherlands",4,4,2,3,4,2,4,4

52,saudia_airlines,Lousy service and conduct,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the lousy service and conduct I received during one of Saudia flights (SV122 LHR – RUH and SV562 RUH – BXB) in August 2023.On the date of 12th August 2023 SV122 LHR – RUH PNR JBS9J7, I was travelling with two children. After doing web check-in I arrived at the counter for boarding pass and documents checking, the staff over the counter was not able to get the APP clearance from DXB, and as a result, I was not getting my boarding pass. That staff took all my documents for further action without giving me any details. I asked about it with another staff, he briefed me a little but not in a polite tone. After half an hour of stressful waiting staff came to me and led me to the counter, at that I came to know that the staff who was handling my documents earlier entered my visa number wrongly in the system which resulted in the decline of my travel from flight to DXB. If the staff would enter the right information, I didn’t have to face it.And my stressful journey continues when I board the flight and the cabin crew came to me and asked me to show them my boarding pass then they said that my baggage is waiting for me outside, and then they escorted me outside the aircraft. When I went out, I saw two Police, two airline security officials and other officials who are related to this flight, then Police asked me if I am having a toy gun, and I informed them that it is a lighter, not a toy gun. As per my information, my baggage went through security screening, do their screeners don't know how to differentiate between a lighter and a toy gun? The scene which all of them created for me was so humiliating as if I was carrying any sort of illegal weapons or what!! Everyone was rude in the first place and wronged me and everyone who is watching this scene was staring at me as if I have done something wrong. The whole scene was so humiliating I even can’t explain you in words. Due to all the hassle, I was not able to have my lunch on time and ate my meal only at night after 07 pm and I am a diabetic patient. In this journey, I was not only mentally stressed but physically as well.After that my troubles continues as when I landed at DXB airport, my baggage was missing. Later on, I came to know that my baggage has not reached my flight so I had to claim it. After claiming that they asked me for the address and said that they will provide me with my baggage within 24 hours at my doorstep. But I got my baggage after 48 hours in a very stinky condition as it was thrown in a bucket full of stinky fish and also it was not delivered to my doorstep. The delivery person called us down of our building and it dropped the baggage on the road itself not even bothering to give us our hands, it was very rude and bad conduct of behaviour's. It took four whole days to recover my baggage's bad smell.I was travelling with Saudia for the first time and it was a terrible experience. I am deeply dissatisfied and felt humiliated by your flight and services. In future, I will not at all travel with this company and suggest the same to all my relatives and friends. Although I have booked a two-way trip so I have already been stuck with Saudia airlines.My return trip is on September 2023, I am afraid of how horrible will be my experience with this flight. Hope they will provide my return flight peacefully. I had Sent complaint email to airlines. Let see whether I will get justice or not.

57,saudia_airlines,"Competitive Prices, Extremely Poor Guest Relations","I flew with Saudia multiple times mostly because their prices were the most competitive ones for my travel plans.The flights themselves were not too bad. Of course, they don't allow alcohol aboard and play their Muslim prayer during takeoff of each flight. This may be seen as enforcing religious beliefs too much on the passengers. I actually saw a passenger confronted about a can of beer that he had bought at the airport and was not allowed to take even to the seating area of the gate.You would think they have a larger selection of non-alcoholic beverages available, since alcohol is prohibited. But no, they only had some 3 different juices to choose from, which is extremely little choice compared to most other airlines. The lack of tomato juice was most disappointing. But nevertheless, the tickets were really cheap, so I would just take it as it is.Unfortunately, my luggage was damaged on one of the flights, which I reported immediately at the arrival airport. This is where the really bad experiences with Saudia's guest relations started:First, I was handed a form to sign, that declared that I received a shiny new piece of luggage from Saudia as replacement. However, I didn't see said replacement anywhere. Of course I refused to sign. Since Saudia doesn't have their own staff at that particular airport, the guy handling the matter didn't really know what to do. But we were able agree, that I strike out the passage about the replacement and proceed with the report.Next, I would have to make my claim on their website. However, the form was nearly impossible to fill out. It was extremely laggy, I had to enter much of the information multiple times. This step literally cost me hours. Only a week later or so after trying over and over again, did I succeed in submitting the claim. It was pain for me as a person very familiar with IT, but our all mothers and fathers would have definitely surrendered before completing this step.Few weeks later, Saudia confirmed that they would compensate the original price of my luggage. Then, they went silent. They didn't ask for my bank details or anything, so I was wondering how they would pay. I tried contacting them multiple times over the course of some weeks. There was no reply. People who I talked to on the phone wouldn't have any information on the case whatsoever.Took well more than a month until I was contacted by someone from the local Saudia office of my country of origin, who finally asked for the bank details to make the payment.However, as it turned out, they refused to pay until I would sign a receipt for the payment. And since I didn't receive the payment yet, I wouldn't sign that thing beforehand. So we ended in a deadlock. They also refused to pay for additional costs for all the hassle of calling their hotline and sending in my claim by mail. The clerk from the local office in my country just stopped replying and thus, the situation was irresolvable.I ended up actually suing Saudia for the amount they initially promised to pay. Only after they received the court verdict, did they pay the promised amount. Of course without having me sign any receipt, that they needed so hard beforehand. I'm now still waiting for them to reimburse me on the cost for the court procedure ...I'll likely fly with Saudia again due to cheap tickets, but I'll sure hope there won't be anything to resolve with their guest relations.","August 13, 2023",2,Date of travel: January 2023,World,3,2,1,1,3,4,4,2

They told me my baggage is in Riyadh while I’m in Dubai.It was such a really bad experienced with this airlines and the team at land.Anyone at my place would be pissed like me-the last was like clam down and stuffs.I’m like I’m clam and relax but I’m upset because many things happened, she don’t know what behind so she should be polite rather than rude with her face expression.she should not be showing this attitude at her work with passengers.At flight as well,a guy from cabin crew member SV562 which flied yesterday morning from Riyadh -Dubai departed at 6.25 .This cabin crew boy pointed and judge at me for my clothes,seriously why he had to stand infornt of many people while I walked from the washroom,there are lots of tourist sitting at plane and wearing those topless clothes..I could have pointed at him that day and ask whats the problem and argue with him and make a scene but I’m not that person gonna waste my time on the cabin waiter.I’m much better than him so why would I waste such time of my life arguing.I make use of that argue time in eating and fly chilling myslef while I enjoy to see him workingHe has no rights to tell me what I wear or where I’m going,it’s a plane ,I’m not at his service while Im going or back from my vacation.He should be trained agian for how to and when to open his mouth. He should simply kept his mouth shut and do his job.He should be even aware who is having a transit flights and not to start judging on what passengers are wearing..I travel a lot quiet often internationally and never ever I had such experience..Lots of things happened on way back to Dubai.I didn’t expect for such.Even if I get my baggage I’m not happy. at all with service.Really disappointed.In future I don’t expect such again while I fly.Thank you for your understanding and patience team airlines.","August 1, 2023",1,Date of travel: August 2023,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",4,1,1,2,3,1,1,1

(i just had a number written on my passport as proof, but this it was i was given as a visa by the immigration in SA).

110,saudia_airlines,Worst customer service experience of my life,"Saudia are fine if nothing goes wrong. If something goes wrong, prepare for one of the most frustrating experiences of your entire life.The planes, flight attendants, food etc are all very good. But for us, something did go wrong.Our first flight was delayed by 5 hours on the tarmac in London, so we missed our connection in Riyadh (despite having allowed 4 hours for it, and despite the flight attendants telling us our plane will be held for us).When we arrived at midnight in Riyadh, the customer service was worse than nonexistent.For 17 hellish hours, overnight and through the day, they:- refused to give us accommodation;- lied to us repeatedly about having booked us on an alternative flight, even saying they were printing us boarding passes for a flight that did not exist;- gave us the middle finger (literally!) when we tried to ask them questions.Some of the ground staff have limited English and struggled to understand what needed to happen when a flight is delayed and a connection is missed.When we found someone who spoke English and informed them about our international rights when a flight was delayed, they said ""that is not Saudi law"".We had to do the job of the ground staff in finding an alternative flight, which they accepted, then refused to give us boarding passes for it.Eventually, we were routed via Jakarta. When we arrived at the transfer desk, they did not have the booking Saudia made on their system.The staff at Jakarta airport were superb and fixed Saudia's mistake for them.In short, if you book with Saudia, pray for a smooth journey or face the consequences.","May 31, 2023",2,Date of travel: May 2023,"London, United Kingdom",5,1,4,4,5,4,4,5

They completely ignored us at the counter and few hours later, managed to book us in another flight from Jeddah to Singapore with a long stopover in Bangkok. Obviously, we arrived more than 7 hours late to Singapore and missed our connection flight with different airline to Hanoi. Once arrived (finally) in Singapore, our 5 suitcases, all lost, no explanation at all, completely ignored on the phone and at the counters. Nothing from them, nothing at all. We spoke with 4 or 5 different agents on the phone and all of them told me to send an email to explain the situation, today, more than a month after the flight, they haven't replied at all. THANKS TO SINGAPORE AIRLINES, they managed to fill a report for the missing luggage (yes, Singapore Airlines is a real company, Saudia is not). Today, 35 days after the trip, they are still ignoring. They delivered the 5 suitcases, 3 of them with serious damage. SAUDIA HASN'T DONE ANYTHING about it. And the cherry on the cake, they complaint form on the Saudia website doesn't work if you fill the booking reference or ticket number, it does work if you put a random number...

They were quick to check on the toilets not causing other travellers inconvenient. The tour agent who is assigned to bring the group for pilgrimage should educate them on hygiene in public places which they fail to do.

125,saudia_airlines,Terrible in predictable ways!,"Terrible in unimaginable ways, yet very predictable. We avoided a plane crash and we are still fighting with the customer (dis)service to get a refund we are eligible for under the EU compensation law. We decided to go through legal ways to get our money back.Here's our little story. We booked our flights from Geneva to Kochi to go on holiday (April 2023), we took off on time, and everything seemed normal. After a few minutes in the air, the plane turned around and landed again in Geneva. We landed on a piste full of fire brigades, police, and technicians, all wearing oxygen masks and tanks! The staff didn't tell us anything about what was going on and they thought that a nice way to calm everyone down was to display a ""Thank you for flying with us"" message on all our screens. Classy, but needless to say: totally useless. At that point, our opposable thumbs skills allowed us to infer that there might have been a fire, or a fire alarm happening on the flight.At the Geneva airport, we were left with no answers, until we decided to leave and a good samaritan from the Geneva Airport (NOT Saudi Airlines) rebooked us for the following day.We immediately tried to submit the refund form through Saudi Airlines' website; however, ALL THEIR FORMS ARE BROKEN, like ALL of them! And that's been the case for the last month, or who knows from when. Do you want to ask for a refund? The form is broken. Do you want to submit a technical request to ask to fix the form? Guess what: the dedicated form is broken too. Do you want to ask a question about anything? The form is broken too. We contacted Saudi Airlines to ask for an email address that could help us submit our forms, but that didn't go well either. We now have a collection of 20 emails from: Marah, Omaima, and many other Saudi Aurlines staff, all saying: ""Submit your requests through [LINK TO A BROKEN FORM]"".This is obviously a tactic to dissuade people from claiming compensation under the EU law EC 261 legislation, which entitles travelers to up to 600 euros if a flight is canceled, or delayed.

Checkin was seamless, onboard service was friendly and attentive, food was delicious, choice of non alcoholic beverages very good. It’s a dry airline but It was actually better for us not having the temptation! Levels nearly on par with the likes of Qatar and emirates. Nice quality amenity kits. Strangely menu provided on short flight but not on long flight, be nice if consistency was there. Welcome drink on both flights, plus Arabic coffee and dates before we’d even taken off, nice touch. The transfer process was smooth, Jeddah had a gleaming marble coated airport, very modern and the largest Sky Team lounge in the world. Nice food and beverages were served.The only downsides I’d say is the layover tend to be long, we had 6 hours, on our way home it’s 13 hours but there is a Aerotel so we’re hoping to check in there. Unfortunately you can’t book online or ahead but they are hoping to change in the future. Also as we are transiting more than 12 hours the rules are you need a transit visa. Luckily you can now do that from the Saudia site, just go to Manage my booking and scroll down. It lasts for up to 4 days, is freeish! I say this because you have to pay around £21 for the compulsory insurance. This was eventually simple enough, but gave me real anxiety for a few months after booking as it was not available on the Saudia site for already booked tickets until the beginning of April. I wrote to Saudia, the tourist board and the Ministry, but got no proper answers. To be honest I think I was conversing with robots! Hopefully it will be much simpler for any new bookings.In summary I would highly recommend the airline if you are looking for a more reasonable option. Every penny counts!!

The cabin is okay but the experience and post service is just terribly bad.","February 21, 2023",1,Date of travel: February 2023,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

181,saudia_airlines,"THE WORST SERVICE IN THE WORLD. CRUEL, INHUMANE & LITERALLY DISGUSTING","I'd never wish this upon my worst enemy what my family went through. Those who just see the in flight staff and nice food is just a facade; I saw their ugly faces behind all the make-up. Please read full story as there's shocking information for you all to know them inside out. My family (7 members including two elderly heart patients & a 3 year) reached Jedda Airport 4 hours before the flight time and the check-in counter said the tickets didn't show any booking; from this point on they were subjected to utter torture at the airport. With VALID BOOKING REFERENCE, the SAUDI AIRLINE cancelled the paid tickets without giving a valid or clear reason. When we tried to purchase new tickets; there were only 2 seats available; so it was clear that the SAUDI AIRLINE had oversold the tickets at higher prices and just dumped some passengers by cancelling the cheaper tickets. We begged and pleaded for help since my mother was BP, Diabetic & heart patient; the Saudi Airline staff could not speak English (will you believe that...); an international airline at an international airport with dumb autocrats sat in office with literally no mannerism, no work ethics, no professionalism and no humanity whatsoever. I called UK Saudi Airline office numbers, Saudi Head Office but both had no emergency or out of office hours access. Even the next all day all I could get through to was Saudi Airline Jordan call centre didn't help at all with group bookings. Saudi Airline phone number +966920022222 was utterly useless as you can't get through to anyone without a 12 digit booking reference; I tried severally all passengers booking numbers but the automated system didn't accept and there was no other option to get though to a customer service...(please note that)4 hours of torture to save the flight and get in; the family's errands between check-in counters and SAUDI AIRLINE office was no more than a shameless naked cruelty to the ladies; the ailing elders and a kid. The flight in this time was missed; we were stranded at the airport and Saudi Airline office blatantly refused any help at all. At this stage, my mother's condition got worse and was at life risk with high blood pressure due to long tiring day and going through the stress inflicted; we went back in to Saudi Airline Office and Hajj & Umrah Ministry and panicked about her medical emergency. At this point a guy called Ibrahim who could speak little broken English did help her to the airport medical facility and promised an alternate flight the next day, a free hotel stay with meals, free transport to the hotel and back to the airport. After spending a night running between offices and counters and sat on waiting benches; this was a little consolation that at least something moved them to mend things. However, the worst was yet to come. We insisted a stay near the airport; the official Saudi Airline staff Ibrahim along with two other assistants escorted the family to a bus outside and said the Saudi Airline didn't have local hotel to stay so they would be take to their Mecca hotel which was 2 hours bus journey. Even though we didn't want that; we had no choice but to board the bus; the official staff said they would send a vehicle to bring you back to the airport too so there's nothing to worry about anymore. I SWEAR TO GOD THIS WAS ALL CHEATING, LIES AND NOTHING MORE. We had an immensely stressful time reaching out to Saudi Airline offices which were closed on Saturday. My cousin who coincidentally was on travel in Saudi and could speak Arabic went on 4 hours journey to Dammam airport and spoke to Saudi Airline office; they simply refused to help and asked to speak to Jeddah Airport office ( the main culprits). Our family was just put into the bus to be taken away; away to Mecca so they could be relieved not dealing with their own booking mess. There was NO HOTEL, NO FREE TRANSPORT NOTHING AT ALL. We had to arrange our own new booking at a hotel, all family Passports were taken by the transport rep who apparently claim transportation costs from govt. After running around all day and night to find these guys with passports and eventually paid money from his own pocket for the transport and took passports after 24 hours.If SAUDI AIRLINE refused to help at the airport and not lied to arrange a hotel stay and alternate flight; it would have been a great act of mercy so we could arrange the alternate flight ourselves. But they put us through more torture by lies and deceit; half the family sick and tired is now on route to the airport while I'm trying to find earliest available tickets; because they wasted our time with lies; the alternate flight tickets have gone up over double the price now. This ordeal is yet to end but this incident, SAUDI AIRLINE BEHAVIOUR, RUDE & INCAPABLE STAFF, LIES & DECIET AND MAKING THINGS BAD TO WORST has deeply and permanently scarred our hearts. In my 20 years of travel memory, I have not seen this worst service ever. Those who may have had good experience with them, remember 'Fire is a good slave but bad master'.

187,saudia_airlines,Worst flight with Saudia,"In all my years of flying Saudia, this has to be the worst experience with them. I had a 12 hour flight to Jeddah and was not pleased with the flight. Firstly, the plane was old which meant some tvs worked while others did not. This meant no entertainment for 12 hours. The staff encouraged families to split up to find a seat that had a working tv. Next, the food serving sizes were quite small, not to mention it was distasteful. I saw many people requesting multiple meals because the initial meal amount was not sufficient. Along with that, there were no amenity kits given, this includes any sanitary wipes before the flight. As a person who has flown with Saudia many times, I described my experience and was not upgraded to a seat. As a multi-million dollar company, I’d expect them to maintain their plane and electronics, the quality and serving size of their food, offer complimentary amenity kits, and upgrade loyal flyers to at least business class for the inconvenience (as they did have extra seats). I really did expect a good experience but unfortunately wasn’t met with one.","February 6, 2023",1,Date of travel: January 2023,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
188,saudia_airlines,Stranded in Mumbai without explanation,"During the flight from Bangkok to Riyadh the screen suddenly flashed and started playing the safety video about landing. After a few minutes of no information the captain announced that we are landing in Mumbai, however he didn’t give a reason for it. We asked the flight attendants, who rudely answered that it was the captain’s decision. They said that we are only stopping for a short while and then we are continuing our journey to Riyadh. We were sitting in the plane for 2,5 hours without any clue what was going on. Suddenly we were escorted from the plane and lead to a long line, still no explanation. The line was around a 1 hour wait for the security control. The workers were incredibly rude and treated us terribly. They didn’t care that we weren’t supposed to stop here and took valuable items from other passangers, such as a drone, which were permitted in Bangkok, but not in Mumbai. The Saudia staff was nowhere to be found for about 5 hours and the airport workers were trying to sort this situation out and book new flights for the passangers but failed. After a few hours these workers avoided the passangers and stopped helping them. The Saudia staff finally arrived after 5 hours, in fresh clothes might I add, however they were incredibly unhelpful and rude. Finally the whole plane was promised to be able to get on the next 10 am Jeddah plane and they made us wait in line for an hour for it. Only the Saudi passangers were able to leave and with that the few Saudia Airline workers left the airport, and the rest of us were left in Mumbai and told that the next flight to Jeddah will leave at 3 am, so in 17 hours! There were a lot of kid passangers who had to sleep on the floor, since we didn’t get any accommodation. Their reasoning behind this was our lack of visa, eventhough there is a Transfer Hotel in the terminal. The staff lied that there aren’t any rooms available, however someone asked the hotel and they said that there are a lot, and if the airline says it’s okay then we could stay there. The airline said no. The policy clearly states that they are required to give us accomodation in this situation. After a lot of phone calls from two passangers (not the airport staff) we finally got a place in the lounge, but only for 4 hours out of our 22 hour stay in the airport, which is absolutely ridiculous. This was our first and last flight with Saudia. We will hand in the compensation inquiry, but without any expectations after the way they handled this situation.

194,saudia_airlines,Saudia AirlineThe worst Airline in the world,"I am writing to you to express my great dissatisfaction with my recent experience with Saudi Airlines. I January 3rd flew Saudi Airlines from Washington DC to Jeddah via Lahore City and encountered terrible service. I lost my Hand-carry which they took away at time of getting into the plane. The service I received from the airline staff was unprofessional, rude, and overly slow. My flight was delayed for 19 hours at Juddah airport, and when I asked the staff for an explanation, they were unable to provide one. The scariest part was that some people were stuck at the airport for four days, waiting for the connecting flight. I also found the staff attitude towards customers to be unhelpful and dismissive. Worse yet, when my flight finally arrived, my hand-carry was nowhere to be found. The baggage that was lost contained items of great value to me, and due to the loss, I suffered a serious inconvenience. I had to purchase new clothes, toiletries, and other items in order to make it through the rest of my trip. I had to pay for these items out of my own pocket. I was also disappointed in the customer service I received when I reported the lost baggage. The staff I spoke to was unhelpful and unsympathetic, and it was clear that they did not take my complaint seriously. They refused to give me a claim number by saying that it was not needed. I have tried to contact the airline both by phone and email, but I have not yet been able to speak to any customer service representatives who can provide me with information regarding my hand-carry. They hung-up the phone on me when I asked for some help.  I am extremely frustrated by the fact that Saudia airline I expect to be compensated for the inconvenience and emotional distress this incident has caused. I have now been without my luggage for over three weeks and have yet to receive any response from the airline. I am writing to you in the hopes that you can help me get my luggage back and ensure that this kind of poor customer service does not happen again.

196,saudia_airlines,Do NOT use Saudia Airlines for Bangladesh holiday!!!,"SAUDIAWe had several problems with Saudia airlines during this trip. Overall, your services are poor especially regarding baggage transfer at transit airports. Manchester to Dhaka, via Jeddah. Our check-in luggage was not transferred from the first flight to the second flight. When we arrived in Dhaka on 25/12/22, our baggage was still in Jeddah. Our luggage was delayed and arrived 3 days later. This delay caused severe distress and inconvenience. This incompetence by Saudia Airlines ruined our holiday. Also, my aunt who was travelling with us has a pacemaker and her blood pressure machine was in these check-in bags. Our bags not arriving with us caused a great amount of stress. Delayed baggage was unfortunately one of many problems we face with Saudia Airlines. The in flight experience on our second plane (Jeddah to Dhaka) was atrocious. Your service should be equal on all flights for all passengers. However, SAUDIA DO NOT RESPECT BANGLADESHI PEOPLE and treat them as lower class. The flight did NOT include basics such as blankets, pillows and earphones. The first flight from Manchester, all of these items were ready in our seats on entering the plane, but on the second flight the basics were nowhere to be seen, we had to ask the cabin crew to provide these and after 30 minutes they finally gave us a blanket. Dhaka to Manchester. Via Jeddah.(Return Journey)After our first journey with Saudia we were shocked to receive an equally bad return journey. When we arrived back in Manchester, our check-in luggage was AGAIN delayed. When we arrived in Manchester on 15/01/23, our baggage was still in Jeddah. Our delayed luggage arrived 4 days later! This time some of the contents in our bags were damaged because there were food items in the bags. We were planning to gift these items to friends & family on our return to the UK, but Saudia Airlines' incompetence has ruined this as well.

The business class is old and it is like roulette if you have a full flat seat or only 90 degree changeable seat. Today, the stuff on the flight SV808 offered a broken seat for me. The male flight attendant was extremely unfriendly, he got a bad day and managed that my correctly proved hand luggage was taken away and put into the cargo. I never experienced this rude way of luggage handling. Saudia sold more seats than their capacity of the aircraft and they tried to get space by making trouble with their flight guests. Unbelievable!!!I was tired as that flight as the delay of 5 hours was the third delay of 4 flights with Saudia.Mostly caused due to technical problems problems. Not sure if it's coming from a poor or missing maintenance of the aircraft itself as the inside equipment and cleaning SOP's are low level. Dirty, smelly, used and patchwork repairing on this flight. The video system has a standard range of movies, the head phones are dirty and this time with function. Carpets haven't seen a vacuum cleaner for some weeks. It makes at least the ants happy. The stuff on the ground floor were in a bad mood due to overwork and overtime to the standard delays from 4 to 7 hours. I can understand their pressure. Anyhow, they are using the time for gambling on their phones outside and inside of the aircraft. Disturbing customer questions are disturbing them. The food selection is 70% the same. Mushroom soup ((cold), overcooked beef or alternatively local food which has a decent strange smell. Drinks are good. Like the berry drink. Today's flight was scheduled for 00.40 AM, than delayed to 03.10 AM, real start (pushing out of the gate) was at 04.15 AM. Kids were bored and starts crying due to the long waiting time. On this specific SV808 flight the female flight attendants were really trying to repair the poor behaviour from the male flight bosses. Technical defects and double seating selling happens several times when I was flying with Saudia. It takes hours to sort it out as they need to find the luggage from the flight guests which are not allowed to stay on board or need to agree to put their hand luggage into the lower cargo. Inside lights are broken and replaced by different models, hopefully it's not done with engine parts. Try to go to the toilet before boarding the aircraft. The bad smell and urin from the arriving flight is still there with the typical flavour of a train station toilet. Normally the 777 has 3 toilets at the front for all flight passengers. On this flight only one super dirty toilet for all business and premium economy passengers. Flight attendant using their own toilets and lock them for personal use. Bring your own toothbrush and toothpaste with you as in business class nothing is provided in business class. You want to have a normal blanket instead of a heavy used polyester blanket? No chance, the smell of the previous guest feet's is guaranteed. I will select in the future European airlines again and the price difference of 10% higher makes obviously the difference for safe and clean aircrafts and a smile from the airline stuff. There must be a reason that the business class at Saudia is limited. I am wishing Saudia good luck, a good technical improvement, a better management of the passenger in advance, a working toilet cleaning management and a structure for their future flight organisation but surely without me. Summary: if you buy cheap, you get cheap and if you buy cheap you buy expensive. My computer was broken in the cargo transport managed by Saudia Airlines. They are not taking the liability.","January 5, 2023",1,Date of travel: January 2023,"Brussels, Belgium",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

217,saudia_airlines,Never again with them,"One of the most awful flying experiences of my life. Since I was quite tired from the previous two flights, I thought it best to purchase a seat with extra legroom so that I could relax and possibly sleep. Upon boarding the flight I had the unpleasant surprise of finding a somewhat ""oversize"" person as my seat neighbor. I asked the crew if I could change seats since this person was leaning on me and I always had to try to stay as squished as possible on the other side (not exactly at the most comfortable situation for an 8-hour flight). They replied that the seat could not be changed and that I had to stay where I was.Awakened for the umpteenth time by the elbowing of my seat neighbor, I went to the bathroom. Once I returned from the bathroom my seat was completely occupied by the sleeping gentleman's arm. I asked the crew if they could do anything or at least tell the gentleman to stay in his seat, but they said there was nothing they could do. At that point I lost my patience and asked to speak to the manager. After standing for half an hour and still not hearing from the manager I started to get angry. At that point the person in charge showed up. I explained the situation and instead of finding a solution, he stared me in the eye and said, ""You should have traveled in business my friend,"" laughing in my face. To recap, I paid for the extra legroom, didn't get my seat, and was made fun of by the crew. I wouldn't wish this situation on anyone.Finally one person from the crew decided to get busy and after almost 40 minutes I was found a seat (which was not without extra legroom).Overall a disastrous and even humiliating experience, I strongly advise against traveling with this company.","January 2, 2023",1,Date of travel: December 2022,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

We still have 9 of us that need to check in their luggage and need the boarding pass. The staff (a guy) yelled at me asked me if i done check in my luggage and get the boarding pass. I said yes. He then yelled at me again and asked me to get out. What an attitude?!!! We were in a group, and 9 of us that couldn't get the boarding pass were their first time travelling with airplane. Of course I need to help them. He didn't tell us why they close the counter. He just told us to go to saudia ticketing counter. One of us asked one of the lady staff nicely at the counter and she said that the seat no longer available. Because they sold the ticket more than the seat they have. It was overbooked. So first come first serve. After a while, 9 of us get the ticket at 1 am to kuala lumpur. When we reached the airport it was 1pm. We were in a bus travelling 7 hours from madinah to jeddah airport. The staff was very rude! Rude! Rude! Rude! Then the flight at 1 am to kl got delayed until 2am. Rude staff! Very rude! Not recommended at all to travel with saudia airlines!

The only problem I had was at Jeddah airport with the signage, I couldn't find departures and the flights being alcohol free, but these were only minor and if it wasn't for these I would have rated them excellent instead of very good. I would definitely use them again and it seems that most of the bad reviews are from people who have bad experiences and not enough from people who have a smooth journey.

I called Saudi Embassy, both in the USA and in India, and none of them replied to either calls or emails. They couldn't provide the transit visa in the US, even though I spend the full amount for the application ( $50). And in India, again the embassy didn't provide one and told me to visit again but with a travel agent, which will charge double the cost of a transit visa.

I was searched like a common criminal twice and spoken too like one too by the Saudi team not airport security.The cabin crew were ok but has no sense of urgency or efficiency so everything was painfully slow and disjointed.

229,saudia_airlines,Treated like dirt with Istanbul service desk - just disgusting. Would not recommend,"Had an unfortunate incident where Istanbul taxi driver took me to the wrong airport as he didn't understand English and I ended up missing my flight - which is ok. That's not the point nor was I expecting anything from anyone. However, what I did expect was to be treated like a human being by the Saudia Service desk when I tried to book another connecting flight. This was a Thursday an I told them, I just needed to get back to Singapore by Sunday and didn’t even mind being put on Economy with either Saudia or their partners. The guy first told me they had nothing apart from a $14k one way ticket with Emirate Airlines and that he could not book me on Economy. When I asked, why I could not purchase an economy ticket, he decided to get angry with me and raise his tone saying this is the ""only ticket available"". I then told him how I checked skyscanner on my way to the airport and there were plenty of tickets, but as my internet didn’t work at Istanbul airport, I asked if he could help me. He then decided to get even more irritated and rolling his eyes. He then told me, ""why did you miss your flight, you are too late, why did you miss your flight, you should come to airport earlier"", clearly using patronizing tone to make me feel stupid. Also for some reason he kept asking me about my ethnic background...which I found really strange an uncomfortable, especially asking where my name comes from. I explained to him my situation of how the taxi driver took me to the wrong airport and I even begged him asking please many times to help and see what they can do. He then sat down, not even acknowledging me and just decided to type angrily something on the computer and then said I found you one ticket for ~$5k economy flight to Singapore with a 15hr layover in Dubai through Emirates Airlines. I asked, ""are you sure this is economy, is there anything cheaper?"". He then yelled at me in a demeaning tone and attitude, saying this is with a ""20% discount already and cheapest flight you can get!"". I just said ""fine, let's book it and thank you for your help"", trying to remain friendly and hoping to calm this guy down as people were beginning to stare at this situation. I am the last guy to ever confront or argue, as it's not my nature and I just wanted to get out of there as I felt embarrassed by the way I was being talked to the whole time. He then asked me to sign the invoice for some reason asking me to acknowledge I was happy being charged this money. I found this extremely strange, but like I said, I had enough and just wanted to get it over and done with, so I didn't ask any questions. And, once it was all done, he just handed me the itinerary and pointed somewhere randomly at an emirates check in desk in the distance, saying it's almost done checking in and I needed to hurry up. I found that weird, considering my flight was in 4 hours, but ok. The I asked him if that was it. He said no, and then asked me to sign some other invoice. I then looked to see if that was it, but he just kept silent and turned his head away from me not even confirming this was it, let alone a thank you and good bye. Essentially treating me like a piece of scum for no reason whatsoever. It was really shocking, as I did nothing to piss this guy off, in face the complete opposite, as I always smile, talk politely and treat people with respect. I just took the itinerary and walked to the check in desk feeling incredibly confused as to what just happened. Simply the worst experience of my life.

I called Saudi customer service to find out why and they said Zam Zam is only for people who make Umrah. I replied and said who made this policy? Do you realize that anybody who has Tourist visa and can visit Madinah and Makkah is allowed by Saudi government to perform Umrah? Customer Service did not understand so I told them I am very upset along with my 70 travel companions and families not being able to bring Zam Zam as we all performed Umrah and had Tourist Visa. In addition I said when was this policy effective and for how long? Rep said I don't know and can't find out. I said do you have this policy written on Saudi Airlines web site? Rep said no. I said I hope this phone call to Saudi airline customer support (800 472 8342) is recorded and sent to the person who's responsible of making this bad policy.

The only information they gave us was that our flight was delayed but they did not offer a single thing on what to do next now that we couldn't catch our transfer flight. We had to book an entire new flight since we all have obligations and needed to be back in time.

251,saudia_airlines,Do not fly with Saudia. Worst customer experience ever.,"Do not fly with this airline. My experience with Saudia was not only the worst that I’ve had with any airline, but also the worst I’ve had with any company. The customer support is virtually non-existent and when you need any form of help, this company proves that it couldn’t care less.I flew with my girlfriend from Frankfurt to Bangkok with a layover in Riyadh. The TVs in our row didn’t work on both flights, but otherwise the flights went okay and the food was pretty good. Once we landed in Bangkok we realised my girlfriend’s bag had failed to arrive. We had noticed in Frankfurt that the Saudia representative at baggage drop hadn’t actually put the bag on the baggage carousel, but at the time we didn’t think much of it. Luckily, we had an Apple AirTag inside the luggage, so we could see it was still at Frankfurt Airport and had never left. We immediately reported it to the baggage department at Bangkok Airport, although there were no Saudia representatives in Bangkok specifically. We filed a Baggage Irregularity Report and were told that Saudia should send the bag within the next few days. We were hoping this was true as we were planning to backpack around Southeast Asia for the next 10 weeks.Saudia never sent the bag to us. We tried contacting them so many times over the following days and weeks. We emailed so many email addresses that we found online, but the majority of them were not even real accounts and so our emails failed to deliver. We tried calling customer service representatives for Saudia in Thailand, Germany and the UK, but either the phone numbers didn’t work, they just didn’t pick up, or they said they couldn’t help at all and we just had to fill out the form online. We filled out the online compensation form in August 2022, but to this day have received no response. We spent nearly €100 on calls from Thailand to Saudia’s helplines but nothing worked. We tweeted them many times and while they did message us back saying they would help, we never heard anything further. This was especially frustrating as the whole time we could see with our AirTag that the bag was just sitting in Frankfurt Airport. It was clear to us that Saudia were making no attempt to find the bag. Eventually, my girlfriend’s parents had to travel to Frankfurt Airport themselves to find the bag. They asked around and showed that they could find it with the AirTag. Luckily, with baggage staff at the airport, they found the bag. Without any help from Saudia. Frankfurt Airport then flew it over to us with Thai Airways, and then we picked it up from Phnom Penh airport in Cambodia, more than two weeks after the bag had gone missing.The worst part was that Saudia never listened to us. They have no customer service and did not offer any help. We were so frustrated because we could see the bag was just sitting there and no effort was being made to find it. We contacted Saudia again and again to tell them we knew where it was, but nothing. We even went back to Bangkok Airport to talk to Saudia representatives in person who are only in the airport at specific times when flights are happening. They were friendly but offered no help, blaming Frankfurt Airport for the issue. When we contacted Frankfurt Airport, they blamed Saudia for not looking for the bag. It was clear to us that if my girlfriend’s parents hadn’t gone to the airport to find the bag, it would’ve just been left there and eventually auctioned off.Saudia did nothing to compensate us despite our requests. We spent €100s on calls and replacement items in the two weeks of travelling without our bag. Other airlines would refund this, but Saudia is so poorly organised that we have given up all hope of ever hearing from them or receiving the compensation we deserve. They have cost us more money than the price of a ticket with a better airline would have. I thought maybe on our return flights they would offer us some sort of compensation or free upgrade, but nothing.Truly the worst experience I’ve ever had with a company. Do not fly with Saudia. It is not worth the risk.","November 24, 2022",1,Date of travel: August 2022,"Abingdon, United Kingdom",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

268,saudia_airlines,Great airline,"I had a really good experience flying with Saudia Arlines in October 2022. I didn’t know what to expect as there are a lot of negative reviews about the airline. I went to Bangkok from Amsterdam with a transfer at Jeddah and a stop in Ryadh. Both ways I had the same good experience. I boarded the plane in Amsterdam with a little delay because there is a lot of chaos at Schiphol at the moment (so most airplanes are delayed). I had to wait for 4 hours(!) to get through the baggage drop-off and security-check because of the staff shortage in the Netherlands. Coming onboard, the staff was really nice and welcomed me with a hot towel. The airplanes are pretty new and the chairs are comfortable. During the flight, they would come about every hour to offer a drink or something to eat. The food was fine. On the six hour flight, I got a standard airplane meal somewhere at the beginning and then something small towards the end (focaccia or pizzabread). Arriving at Jeddah airport, you have to go through a quick scan with your hand luggage. As there are no staff shortages there, it all went super fast (maybe 10-15 min). I didn’t have to go through a scan with my check-in luggage. The airport itself looks nice, all international flights now arrive at the newly built terminal. Toilets were clean and there are lots of chairs everywhere. There also is a airport hotel that you can book when you arrive. There is no website available, so you just come there and book a room for 6, 12, or 24 hours. I think prices start at around 130$ renting a room for 6 hours (per room, not per person), 170$ for 12 hours. You can’t reserve beforehand but they said it’s never full. I didn’t try a hotel room myself.For my next flight, we boarded quite early (45-60min before the flight). I think we even left a bit early. The stop-over took a bit longer, maybe 2 hours. You just stay in the plane while new passengers come in. The flight arrived exactly on time in Bangkok and I was happy to see my luggage was there (since I read the stories about missing luggage). The way back was more or less the same experience. We left a bit late from Bangkok, so the transit was a bit shorter. There was an extra check before boarding the airplane and in Ryadh some people came in to check passports and the tickets to Jeddah (probably as people were getting out at Ryadh, making sure no one was going to Jeddah with a ticket only to Ryadh). Again, we boarded quite early for the flight to Amsterdam (45-60min before departure). We arrived exactly on time in Amsterdam.The only negative comment I can think of is that they don’t have English subtitles for movies (only Arabic). With all the sounds of the airplane it’s sometimes hard to follow because you don’t hear everything. However, they have a good number of movies, series and music in their program. Lots of western movies (as well as Indian, French, etc.) and also some of the latest. Some parts of the movies are cut out to make them more appropriate. I would definitely recommend this airline to everyone as I’ve had a great experience flying with Saudia airlines.","October 19, 2022",5,Date of travel: October 2022,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

270,saudia_airlines,Sorely Disappointed,"I really had high hopes for Saudia but this airline left me unexpectedly disappointed. There are several issues I have with the airline due to their service, inconsistencies. #1 for some reason picking a seat online through their site doesn't mean it will be guaranteed to you. I choose specific seats for all four seats in a round trip on the airlines site but each flight I never got the seat I picked online. At baggage check-in I would get a print out for a totally different ""random"" seat and I put random in quotes cause it ends up being the worse seat possible. For example one flight with no TV and the last I was packed like a sardine in a row next to the bathroom but the flight was half full and so empty babies could be lied down across two seats (and of course I'm seated next to the infamous cougher that forgets the world was just shut down for 2 years because of airborne virus). Again it wasn't the seat I confirmed online. Another thing Saudia likes to do is pack the plane even though a day before checkin there are empty seats all over the online map so it is a false portrayal of how you're going to be seated. This was consistent on my trip leaving USA and heading for their main layover stop in Jeddah in each direction.Another thing I don't like is how the employees will only make announcements in Arabic as if they could care less about the American/English customers they are so desperately trying to attract for business. Right at the gate one of the head male employees made a long announcement we couldnt understand and he couldn't be bothered to repeat it in English. Also the caption on the entertainment couldn't be changed from Islamic to English. I tried several ones and it never worked.I really dislike their tsa at their main layover stop in Jeddah. First why do I need to go through 5 luggage and passport checks for a transfer? And they are very rude and inconsistent as well. At the second check, three very rude young ""men"" convinced me why I should never fly with saudia again. While five people ahead of me walked through the detectors with their shoes on no problem. I was told I needed to take mine off when it was my turn. I put my shoes on machine and they got stuck mid way. Instead of politely grabbing my shoes he proceeded to use the tip of his fingers and pick them up by the laces because apparently they were too disgusting to touch. They also interrogated my friend behind me and almost made us miss the next flight. After going through the excessive amount of check points my bag was searched because of a ""spray"" ""identified"" by the ill trained tsa agent. I asked could they be more specific about what they found but no answer. I was totally ignored. After basically dumping everything out of my bag. No ""spray"" was found and nothing confiscated. What a bunch of jerks at saudias tsa in Jeddah. As an American citizen I'm not the one you need to be watching out for, better to look within.The only reason why I'm giving 1 star is because of the amount of food and drink (3 meals, snacks, drinks hygiene products etc). Not that it was so delicious but different and abundant. And the one Asian stewardesses who was nice most of the time.","October 15, 2022",1,Date of travel: October 2022,,4,2,2,4,3,3,3,1

We had to wait for 6 hours for transport to be provided to go to our hotels - poor customer service, only a bottle of water and biscuits were provided in the whole 6 hours of waiting in the heat and standing up in a line as we were told to do so by staff. Once in the hotel - we checked in at 6:00am, no communication with regards to our rescheduled flight, had to chase it up myself. We were also unable to contact Saudia as they were not available on weekends. Was rescheduled to fly 3 days past my supposed flight - if I didn’t look it up myself I would not have known about my rescheduled flight, no email or calls from Saudia.

277,saudia_airlines,It's completely dependent upon the context,"Flying business class from Jeddah to Casablanca, honesty, it was like a dream. Excellent service.I flew business with them from Riyadh to Amsterdam and it was also very, very good. Flying their Qassim - Riyadh domestic route, in business, is also very good. Economy: I flew economy with them in 2014, from Jeddah to Los Angeles, and it was absolutely fine. I had an exit row seat and plenty of legroom. As a very tall man, no issues there. I flew with them in 2019 from Washington D.C. to Riyadh, and again, absolutely fine. Their attendants were fine. No issues to complain about. I had four seats to myself, and I went to sleep. I last flew economy with them in January of 2021. Aside from typical economy, nothing was wrong, except a racist black woman in front of me kept looking back at me and giving me dirty looks, and eventually started complaining because she had to sit in front of me, a white man, but to hell with her. Typical arrogant New York attitude. I will probably fly with them for some time to come. The main issues people are complaining about are delays and baggage issues, mainly coming out of Jeddah, and from my understanding, these issues have been fixed? Yes? No? I don't know. From my understanding, their aircraft are safe and they maintain them. Their pilots are trained in the USA, many of them have flown in the Saudi Air Force and they gained a lot of flying experience learning from the US Air Force, some of the best pilots in the world. The Saudia pilots I have met were disciplined and polite; they know what they are doing. Nothing but respect for them.So they are a bit expensive, but that's what you get when the US Dollar is devalued and an allied country's currency is also devalued as a result. The Riyal has been affected heavily by a devalued dollar, thanks to Joe Biden and his irresponsible spending. Either way, none of that really matters if all you really want is a comfortable seat. Saudia has the most comfortable and spacious economy class seat I have sat in. Their business class product is superior to many other airlines. No alcohol, so if you like to drink while you fly, then fly with another airline. If alcohol is not an issue, then fly with Saudia. You will enjoy it, especially their business class product.

278,saudia_airlines,Staff made us almost miss our flight,"coming to our really bad experience with Saudi Airlines. So, when we were checking in on our return flight at Jaddah airport, the person checking us in really didnt know what she was doing. Her name is Renad Hassan, because of her and her supervisor (the tall guy with a beard, dont know his name,) we were about to miss our connecting flight from Riyad. First of all she was so confused and stuck that she couldnt understand how to give us boarding passes to our connecting flight ticket, kept saying, how from Jaddah to Riyad then London how. So we were stood there 29-25mins. So, the supervisor came and had a go at her, and after that she kept asking help from her other colleagues and managed to give our boarding passes, BUT said we could not take the Zamzam water, because its a domestic flight. We told her the supervisor said we could because we had an umra visa. She kept saying no, and made us call the supervisor, who wasnt in sight for 10-15mins. Again, the colleagues started laughing at her and said you are allowed, they can take it. She again asked for the luggage tickets from us and accepted the Zamzam water. I had clearly asked the supervisor what to do related to the bags at Riyad, because she had asked us to check in again there. He said yes, just go pick up your bags from the luggage belt and give your bags in at Riyad check in counter, but dont check yourselves again. So, we did what the supervisor told us. The bags never showed up at Riyad airport. Our connecting flight was at 255am. We were still searching for our luggage at Riyad airport till 125-135am. We finally had a feeling that those two idiots were not well trained and this was not a self check in connecting flight, so we went to the baggage service and were told, no they were wrong, your bags go to your next flight, you dont need pick them up here physically and check in again. So now we had to go to terminal 2 for our flight to london. Guess what, we found out we had to get there by a shuttle bus, and the time was 145 when we got on the bus. When we got to the terminal we were told the gates were closed for our flight, because it was 217am. The flight was at 240, gates close 20 mins before the flight. So, i said we still have 3 mins to the deadline, plus its not out fault, its the supervisors fault. They asked me which supervisor, when i told them, they laughed and said why did he say that, you dont need to recheck in your bags. So, finally we were told to head to our flight. To sum up, we will definitely let anyone heading to Saudi know of our experience with the train bag rule and the inexperienced check in staff at the Jaddah airport. I think its better and safer to take connecting flights with airlines that are frequent in that, and Saudi Airlines should let them take care of connecting flights hahah. SAUDIA PLEASE let Turkish, Emirates, and Qatar handle the connecting flights, please just have direct tickets! One more thing, people have no concept of the line/queuing system. They ignore the line, and just try to go in front of people until they are told to get at the back of the line. This was happening everywhere!

288,saudia_airlines,Delays on both legs of the trip!!!,"First to be fair I need to split the review into two parts. The flight being late both trips. And the overall experience of the flight itself when the plane finally did leave.Late departures from Singapore and MaleWe were scheduled to leave for our trip to Male on Sep 4 20:35 but after waiting till 3h after the scheduled departure time we were told the plane will only depart on Sep 14:00. So we had to go home and spend the night back home and I wasn’t able to get to Male as planned. This wasn’t just a simple issue of being late one night as we were scheduled to take a domestic transfer to Baa Atolls. What compounded the issue further was the plane on Sep 5 departed late again from the 14:00 scheduled time to 17:00 and by the time we got into Male, we missed the domestic transfer! So I ended up wasting my very expensive full board accommodations on Baa Atolls and had to pay for the Male hotel again for Sep 5 night as my Sep 4 night was a no show!Saudi we heard did put the overseas customers in a hotel but the locals were asked to go back and come back again the next day. The transport cost was reimbursed when we came back to the airport to check in.We finally got to our final destinations in Baa Atolls on Sep 6. When you are on a short beach holiday every day, every hour counts! We lost a full 24h of fun and sun in the Maldives as a result of the long delay. Also the staff kept telling us to check with the ground crew when we got to Male but there wasn’t anyone to help us unless you try to go back into the departure side of the airport in Male. Fortunately our hotel had someone to meet us cos of our missed check in the day before as he needed to advise us of our new domestic transfer one day later.

301,saudia_airlines,Avoid as a woman and/or vegetarian - surprisingly awful service!,"I so rarely write reviews, but felt after such a rough trip that this should be an exception. As a frequent international traveler, I'm very used to connecting through Dubai, etc., and waiting in long queues. What I am not used to is having such poor customer service on so many levels. My flight from London to Bangkok was uneventful, minus one of the worst lines for economy check-in I've received (bag drop and check-in were the same line, which is not great!). The way back was another story - and all could have been avoided with basic customer service / acknowledgement of errors. To begin, my pre-ordered vegetarian meals were not available. I was told I hadn't ordered them, showed them the VEG written on my boarding pass, and then was told there must have been a mistake and they had no food for me to eat (on an 8 hour flight!). This happened on both return flights. There was no way to escalate a complaint and I was told to go onto the website later to seek a small reimbursement. Honestly, the appalling lack of interest in flight attendants to find me anything to eat at all was the worst part. I had to ring 3 times just to get a tiny snack! This wouldn't have been a problem if I'd known to grab food before the flight, but it's really bad that the airline advertises that it has vegetarian or vegan meals. I talked to a few other passengers who had this happen to them as well, so definitely a systematic issue.The other issue was Jeddah airport. Be aware that they will send you to separate security as a woman, which in my case added about 15 minutes to security. Then there's additional security at the gate. At my gate, a woman confiscated my TSA-approved power bank and threw it with my adapter into the trash. When I asked to speak to a manager (I specifically have this sort of electronic in my carry-on, as per airline policy), I was told they were only in the men's line and waved off. I made a small scene (feminism at work!), and was then told to wait at the gate for a manager. No manager comes, multiple staff are standing by idly, and then they say I've missed the flight! I managed to talk to yet another manager who let me onto the flight in tears. Again, all of this experience could have been avoided had I not flown through Jeddah (NOT the same as Dubai, etc. in treatment of women) and had there been basic customer service to acknowledge errors and try to rectify them. I then lodged a complaint using the online form I was directed to, and...2 months later...got a message thanking me for flying Saudia and stating that the comment was closed. No recourse or even acknowledgement of the meal issue or confiscation of allowed property.In short, never again with Saudia!

311,saudia_airlines,Arrogant: Saudia does not care about customer satisfaction,"On the air-bridge, without warning, Saudia cabin crew bizarrely decided to security-search all passengers before stepping onto the plane, despite our having just gone through exaclty the same at Tunis airport 5 mins prior.All of us had to open our bags for inspection and then be frisked.When I board a plane (especially in business class) I want to be greeted with enthusiastic, warm, friendly staff - However, in this case it literally felt like I was entering a pretentious nightclub with the cabin crew looking as if we owed them a favour by allowing us on. I'm not sure if Saudia staff have been trained on performing security checks, but major problems arose when they 'suspected' one business class passenger of having a 'suspicious' device on him. Instead of removing him, or having him step aside whilst they allowed everyone else on, they decided to back up a queue of about 60 passengers in the business class lane whilst they waited for him to voluntarily return to the terminal.As he was cleared by the Tunisian airport security staff they obviously saw no need to remove him so he basically just stood there in a stalemate with Saudia staff (I dont blame him for being extremely annoyed and standing his ground!), who gave no reassurances to the rest of us nor any explanation of what was going on.After one hour of waiting on the air bridge they finally let everyone on without an ounce of remorse, explanation, nor apology. Only one cabin crew member was friendly and showed customer care, the rest of them acted like border control immigration officers ... icey-cold, poker faced, direct, and completely indifferent to customer satisfication.What frustrated me most about the whole experience was not the event itself, but the sheer arrogance Saudia's staff dispayed all throughout and after the indicident. I understand people make mistakes sometimes but this looked completely habitual - they really need to implement proper training internally.Perhaps this was a one-off but I will not take another costly chance on Saudia business class again, especailly as I pay for such tickets from my own pocket.","August 7, 2022",1,Date of travel: August 2022,,3,1,2,2,3,2,1,1

It's been 1.5 months and I still hasn't receive my luggage. The in flight experience was okay but trying to reach their customer service team is nearly impossible.

315,saudia_airlines,Most memorable flight of a lifetime: THE WORST!,"Traveling with family of four on Saudia for the first and last time ever.While the delay of our flight from Barcelona to Jeddah was still acceptable, as those things can happen, I was more than shocked about the deliberate neglect of customer service at Jeddah airport. While my travel agent Trip.com had already informed me 12 hours before scheduled departure of connecting flight in Jeddah, that there would be changes to our flight from Jeddah to Bangkok, stating that the departure time would remain the same, but the arrival time in Bangkok changed from 17:00h to 18:50h, which at first did not make sense to me, the events at Jeddah airport eventually made this clear.After arrival at Jeddah airport I enquired about this change in flight details, wondering why the same flight would now take almost 2h longer than initially announced, I was told by one of SAUDIA’s airport staff superiors (a gentleman in traditional Arab attire) in a rather rude and patronising manner that there weren’t any changes at all to this flight and should there be any changes that we would be informed right away. While this information was given to me at around 00:30h it took SAUDIA until 04:00h (boarding time) to inform its passengers about the initial delay of our flight to Bangkok of about one hour.After eventually having boarded the plane, passengers were told about 45 minutes after boarding that the plane could not take off due to technical issues. Passengers were asked to disembark the aircraft again and were told to go to another gate where staff would be waiting to assist us with everything else.On arrival there were only two soldiers at the gate. After 15 minutes Saudia staff arrived.Despite several passengers asking for refreshments, wi-fi access to make phone calls and to be told the truth, i.e. gate info showed new departure time as 7:00h (still at 6:55h), but no airplane to be seen, staff only smiled friendly and laughed a lot (probably also about us), but did not do anything to help us. There was not ONE actual responsible at the gate. All the female staff just simply said “I’m not the manager…”Eventually passengers were informed that the only option to get to Bangkok was to fly via Riyadh where other passengers had to be picked up.On board a Saudia official “apologized” by continuing with telling us lies about “unforeseen difficulties”, etc.After pick-up of passengers in Riyadh, one of them told me that he had arrived 36 hours earlier in Riyadh, to continue to Bangkok. On arrival they had to stay 10h at the airport and eventually in a hotel ""due to technical problems with the plane"" . The curious thing though is that these passengers were already told approx. 20h before OUR ACTUAL DEPARTURE FROM JEDDAH that they would be picked up by our flight.(This explains the new arrival time with 1:45h delay, which I was notified of by email from Trip.com.)While I was satisfied with the quality of the on-board services provided during the flights, I have never ever encountered such a disrespectful treatment of passengers by any airline officials.Not only did SAUDIA fail to inform its passengers about the flight changes on time, i.e. 8h before departure like my travel agent had done, but it is absolutely unbelievable that SAUDIA officials then continue their negligent customer communication by deliberately and knowingly LYING to its customers. None of the events that unfolded were due to “unforeseen technical difficulties”. I was informed by my travel agent about the change in flight some 8h before the scheduled departure time (other passengers had not) and the passengers that were picked up in Riyadh had been informed some 20h before, that they would be picked up by our flight. Despite all of this, SAUDIA seemed to think that their customers are naïve and continued to feed us lies.Being a seasoned traveler and having experienced the great hospitality of other airlines which claim to be one of the best 15 airlines in the world (i.e. Qatar Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Emirates, Lufthansa, etc.), I have never felt such disrespect and poor customer relations as I had to experience with SAUDIA.Apart from the stress this has caused to me and my family, it also incurred additional costs as I had to not only purchase refreshments and food at Jeddah airport after our scheduled departure time (although SAUDIA legally would have had to provide at least drinks during the first hours of our delay), but I also had to make a phone-call with my Spanish phone (as airport wi-fi failed to work for me and my family after approx. 1h after arrival at Jeddah, which other passengers had also reported) to inform the limousine company I had booked for our airport transfer to the hotel in Bangkok about our delay, which incurred charges of over €44. On top of this I also lost my reservation at Vincent Thierry’s Michelin star restaurant The Chef’s Table, which I had booked for my wife’s and mine 26th wedding anniversary.Overall, this flight will be the most memorable one of my lifetime, not only because of the anger, financial loss and frustration it has caused me and my family and also the unprofessional handling of this whole affair by SAUDIA airport staff, i.e. not even a cup of coffee or a glass of water at the gate (which by law should have been provided). My foremost memory of this flight will be the non-existent passenger information and the blatant lies that I and all other passengers have been told by SAUDIA about “unforeseen” technical problems. Unfortunately my family and I will have to fly back with SAUDIA and we are dreading the nightmare that might await us at the end of our holidays. This was my first and last time flying with SAUDIA.","August 2, 2022",1,Date of travel: August 2022,"Alicante, Spain",3,1,3,2,3,3,1,4

My Saudi Air flight in Istanbul was cancelled. This was one of the worst airline experience I have had as a frequent flier with over 400,000 miles flown. I had to spend 25 hours in transit (15 hours in Istanbul and 10 hours Riyadh) instead of 4 hours as per my original itinerary without any compensation, accommodation or food. When I first arrived at the transit desk in Istanbul, the ground staff told me that the flight was cancelled and that I should call my travel agent. My travel agent then told me to contact the ground staff for accomodation. On returning to the transit desk, I was told that there was a shift change and new staff will be there in 5 minutes. Instead, I waited for 1 hour, and was told by a staff that the flight was cancelled and he could not do anything about it. After much discussion, a staff told me that their system shows that I am rebooked on a flight on July 9, 10 days from my current flight. He said I should head out of the airport to check with the Saudi Air office and that someone would be there (there was no one after I went out).

I ended up traveling downtown and booked my own hotel after calling the travel agent and he informed me that I was rebooked on a flight 15 hours later.

337,saudia_airlines,I made an account just to warn others about this airline,"Alright, I'm going to go ahead and put this in to steps, because buckle up it's going to be a long one.-I got on the flight and it was delayed for 4 hours because one of the wing flaps had come loose-""alright, fair enough"" but then they turned off the entertainment despite the TV screens still being on??-after four hours they took us off the plane and gave us our luggage back-about a hundred of us were screwed over, they sent a few customer service reps to minimise the damage-50 of us were put up in a hotel because we didn't have anywhere else to go-""oh, ok, I can get a later return flight in return...right?"" ""Oh yeah of course, we'll see what we can do""-we got to the Marriotte hotel who by the way we're actually fantastic, except for the fact that it's really big and I had to walk up/down a flight of stairs with heavy luggage because no lifts-we got told that we could only stay one night because there was a Harry Styles concert taking up the rooms the next day-oh that's ok because the airline told the hotel that they'd get us all on flights the next day!-they did not.-""we've never actually seen anything like this""- hotel staff who have dealt with many flight delays but were appalled at Saudias complete lack of organisation. They didn't answer any phone calls despite charging for calls!-I ended up going to the airport with another lad and we finally managed to get put on another flight (total of 30 hours later) after pestering a swissport guy (airline authority for Manchester airport) for half an hour-only 6 out of 100 managed to get a flight for the next day-...hmm no change in return flight, I'll ask Saudia-ah, so Saudia have no information desk, I'll ask Swissport-I have to phone booking.com?.. ok. So that's what I did and booking.com told me that Saudia would email me since booking.com couldn't makes return flight for free without Saudias ok-crazily enough, they never emailed me so I had to email and phone several numbers none of which got me anywhere-I ended up having to physically go to the Saudia office in Manila-I ended up having an ""interesting conversation""Me: ""So, I've explained the situation, can I get a flight on the 2nd instead of the 28th?""Rep: ""of course sir, that'll beMe: ""that's a lot of money, it shouldn't be that much, it was your companies fault that the plane was delayed""Rep: ""that's just how much it's going to cost, you're asking for a new flight with little notice""Me: ""Well, yeah, you people screwed up my flight with little notice, of course the flight's going to be more expensive""At this point she asked what I meant so I started writing down on a piece of paper how plane tickets are more expensive closer to the day. She stopped me when she finally gathered why I wasn't willing to pay the stupid fee.Me: ""the rep at Manchester airport said I wouldn't have to pay for it""Rep: pretending to type a bunch of nonsense letters on the keyboard, I was looking at the keyboard, genius.Rep: ""we can't do that ""Me: ""the rep said otherwise, can you not just cancel my flight and put me on a different flight by your airline""Rep: ""no, we can't do that, we already compensated by putting you on the earliest flight possible""Me: ""yes, but your company still delayed my flight by 30 hours, that's indisputable""Rep: ""I'm not allowed to do that""Me: ""ok, who can?""Rep: ""my supervisor""Me: ""ok, can I talk to the supervisor?""Them: proceed to mock me in Tagalog. Newsflash, changing your language doesn't change the tone and saying ""supervisor"" whilst laughing is about as subtle as being hit with a rock labelled ""we think you're a Karen""Sup: ""we can't do that""Me: ""why can't you do that?""Sup: ""we've been told that we can't""Me: ""who told you that you can't""Sup: ""we have to follow procedure""Me: ""alright, who gave you the procedure?""Sup: ""it's just the procedure we follow""Me: ""I get that, but who actually gave you the procedure?""Repeat last 2 lines x10Me: ""look, your company screwed me over and I know my consumer rights. I'm not asking for hundreds in compensation, I'm just asking for you to put me on a different flight, you won't lose any money""Sup: ""we can't do anything""Me: ""ok, whoever is stopping you, I want to talk to them""Sup: ""it's an automated system, we can't change it""Me: ""I'm not asking you to change it! Just let me talk to someone who CAN manually override it so I don't have to pay the difference!""Sup: ""that's not possible, it's an automated system""They started rolling their eyes at each otherMe: ""I've worked at a similar company before, the system didn't just come to life on its own, there's someone who maintains the system, can you phone them?""Sup: ""we can't phone them""Me: ""why can you not contact them?""Sup: ""they're in Saudi Arabia""Me: ""are you seriously trying to tell me that you can't contact the people who run the company that you're part of?""Sup: ""you'll need to phone them""So I got my phone out and demonstrated what happens every time I try to phone them. It just doesn't work.Sup: we don't have the contact number for themMe: ""...how did they give you the procedure then?""Sup: ""email""Me: ""then can you email them?!""Sup: ""no""-At this point they essentially explained that they're the airline equivalent of McDonald's cashier's. So I asked for an email to contact because they were never going to do anything to help even if they could.-funnily enough, the email didn't work. See picture 1.-then I tried the link from the automatic rejection email. See picture 2-I finally found the right ticket and submitted it, they rejected it automatically. See pictures three and four.-they genuinely tried to claim that we're square by giving me a different flight, I still got delayed by a day and a half! I can't just to to the Philippines whenever I want!-my girlfriend is now trying to get her brother who lives in Saudi Arabia to see what he can do-it would have taken like five minutes to just put me on a different flight. Yes it was a more expensive flight but it's the same amount of petrol, the expense is from the company. It's like me charging £10,000 for a baseball on eBay then buying it from myself for £10,000, I don't lose any money??I sincerely hope that every Saudia airlines customer service representative get delayed I'm every aspect of their lives. I'm not just meaning the flights, I hope their graduations get delayed by 30 hours, I hope they take 30 hours to give birth to their children, I hope that it takes them 30 hours for their showers to turn hot.

338,saudia_airlines,Terrible - Overpriced and Useless,"Given that the price is well above that on real 5-star airlines, you would hope that the experience was at least in line with those competitor airlines. The reality is 5-star price, 1-star experience. Firstly, the boarding experience was absolutely chaotic. The flight was delayed by about 45 minutes in order for reshuffling of passengers to sit where they wanted with their families, because they didn't bother pay a bit to reserve their seats before hand. Even worse, non-Saudis were expected to give up their seats to accommodate Saudis requests! After that stress, it would be nice to relax and use the entertainment system. But no! The whole system was down and despite requests from numerous passengers, it took about 2 hours to get the system started. Even after that, many screens failed.The next alternative to pass the time was to try and sleep. However, the food service took over 3 hours to come and when it did it was a terrible breakfast, which was mostly inedible. As for the gift packs for children that are usually provied by airlines, none was provided.As for the crew, the crew of mostly young men were more interested in chatting amongst themselves. At some points this was dangerous, since they didn't enforce passengers being seated just before landing !","June 23, 2022",1,Date of travel: June 2022,,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1

Unfortunately, this is the cost of flying with an airline that isn't reputable, like Singapore airlines. Unfortunately this was the only flight available for our dates so we had no other option.

Our luggage was stranded at another airport for 5 days, which pretty much ruins your trip.5.

379,saudia_airlines,Saudia airlines disrespect towards its customers,"What is happening from Saudia Airlines towards Sudanese passengers traveling to Khartoum is contempt and scorn toward them. The problem exists since Thursday, April 28, 2022, which is that they did not ship all the luggage of the passengers, which led to the accumulation of luggage and its delay. I came on a plane on Saturday, April 30, 2022, until now -4 days- my luggage didn't arrive, every day for the past 3 days i go to the airport waiting for my luggage to arrive in thier two scheduled flights but nothing arrived. In every flight there are alot of passengers whom their luggage didn't arrive also. As an airline, you know how many passengers you have, and how many pieces of baggage will be shipped in every flight how do you accept luggage exceeding the plane’s capacity? Is this all in order to get the excess baggage price? And at the expense of the poor Sudanese passenger? Well, the solution could be bring a larger plane or send the late luggage on a cargo plane. but NO Why? because they don't want to spend extra penny and there is no body in Sudan that demands the rights of the Sudanese passengers. From here, I am addressing everyone who has suffered from the same problem with Saudia Airlines, that he files a complaint about them with the Saudi Civil Aviation Authority, and the more complaints there are, the more valuable the complaint will be.","May 3, 2022",1,Date of travel: April 2022,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also telephoned the Customer Care centre several times before departure to check the flight and was told Terminal 1. Your Saudia Airlines website also showed Terminal 1 departure. In actual fact, the flight was not from Terminal 1, it was from Terminal 2. This incorrect information caused me a lot of stress and high blood pressure. I was travelling for Umrah and should have been relaxed. Instead, I was very stressed upon arrival at the airport. I could have missed my flight due to the incorrect information provided by Saudia Airlines about the departure terminal. 2. Upon arrival at Jeddah Airport, I had to wait for over 2 hours in the baggage claim hall because the luggage was sent to the wrong zone within the airport complex. I had a business class seat, with Sky Priority, so my luggage should have been out early. There is no seating area at baggage claim. No water was provided by Saudia Airlines staff, whilst we stood and waited in our Ihram for over 2 hours. The Saudia Airlines staff and supervisor / management inside baggage claim were very unhelpful and did not show any customer care. No refreshments provided whilst we stood on our feet, waiting for our luggage to be found and brought to the correct zone. No duty of care was shown by Saudia Airlines staff within the baggage claim area. I paid a lot of money for my Business Class seat and did not receive the service expected, as described above. Instead, my ourney from Manchester to Jeddah airport was full of stress, all caused by Saudia Airlines.

Pandemic and preemptive travel closures, sure.- We had to call the customer service department multiple times *just* to cancel our full itinerary. They kept giving us the run around - telling us to contact their WhatsApp support line (more on this), or to email them. Finally, after no success on those fronts, they were able to cancel the flights on our 5th or 6th phone attempt. - They claim the customer service phone department - where you can talk to actual humans - is completely disconnected from refunds processing - and you can only do the latter via WhatsApp or email.- The WhatsApp support is the laziest, most lackadaisical responsiveness I've ever seen. They claim 24/7 support but regularly take 6-10 hours to respond to a chat and start a conversation. When they do reply (usually with 1 word or 1 line), if you don't reply within 10 minutes they close the chat out and you have to start the conversation all over again with another agent. - I repeated this cycle for 4 days on repeat just to be able to submit a simple refund request FOR A FLIGHT THAT THEY HAD CANCELLED.- Phone support was unwilling to process a refund. Once I did eventually get through a submit a refund claim via WhatsApp, the phone agent was unable and unwilling to give me any indication of refund status.- So, unclear now whether I've even been refunded for a flight that the AIRLINE cancelled.DO NOT FLY SAUDI AIRLINES.

I travelled with my husband and in laws. The night before our flight, I tried to check us in online. All of us could check in except for my husband who had a ‘ticket error’. I called to ask what the issue was, the rep on the phone said he could not see any problems on his end, and to just check in at the airport. When we tried to check in at the airport, the lady working there said there was a ticket error and he could not be checked in, and that we had to speak to guest relations. We went to guest relations and he said there was an error with the ticket and we had to purchase a new one. He did not give any other options, except for that we had to buy a whole new ticket but did not explain why. We argued until they re-issued him a ticket. Mid conversation, he would turn away and speak to his friends while we were still speaking to him. When we got a new ticket and went to check in again, they checked in all of our bags except for my husband. They said we were not going to make our flight so he was going to have to take his checked bags on the flight with him (???? Have you ever heard of that? Taking your CHECKED BAGS on the flight with you?). He had to carry his 50lb bags with him through security and on to the plane. We still don’t know why they didn’t check the bags in. They also said that our connecting airline would not take our Zamzam water so we could not take it. We ended up checking in a box of Zamzam water anyways and it did get to us at home, so I don’t know why he told us we couldn’t check it in. We flew from Jeddah to Calgary with 2 connections in between and they only printed 1 boarding pass, leaving us to scramble at the next connecting airport to get the rest of our boarding passes. There were more issues but this review is getting long so I’m going to leave it at this. Horrible horrible service - staff don’t want to help you unless you’re a Saudi national. I literally got more help from the janitors working at the airport than from the Saudi Airlines staff. None of them are trained to do the jobs, and they clearly don’t want to help you. They will leave mid conversation to talk to their friends and co workers. The only way to get helped by them is to get in their face and yell which is exhausting.

When I asked why, I was told by the airline representative“ I don’t know, this is not part of my job” 😱Not only was I shocked by the answer by the gentleman (Ahmed Yehia) continued to brush me off by telling me I should have confirmed before I came to the airport and that I needed to step out of line and go back out past security and check at the reservation desk. 😱😱😱😱😱After speaking to a manager (who was less rude and trying to accommodate me but still had no answers for me) I finally asked them to rebook my ticket and I would pay for it and deal with the credit card company later if I was charged twice. An hour and several rude encounters later, a very unprofessional lady rebooked my ticket after admitting that their booking app was faulty, but told me the cost would be double. Needless to say, I did not fly with them that day and bought a cheaper ticket on a direct flight as opposed to their flight which would have included two transit stops.I only chose this airline because it it is an alliance with KLM and AirFrance, but never again.

512,saudia_airlines,Fair airline brought down by the worst possible airport experience,"I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful and well served Mumbai airport is. Beautiful ambience and energy restaurants serving fresh food made to order. But things rapidly went downhill from there.Saudis Airlines itself had comfortable leather seats and the interior was fairly clean. Every seat had some dried water marks. That possibly reflects on heavy use and wear and test on certain routes at certain times, but the clean up staff should address this. If you ever get the last section of seats on most airlines, you run the risk of them running out of the menu selection / choices. That happened to me twice on the initial and connecting flight. The crew was not consistent in what they offered and how's they offered. It was pretty blatant that Arabic speaking clients were cared for first obviously. Snacks and sandwiches were routinely brought over whereas when I requested a hot chocolate... On their menu, the response was, ""but we have to go back and make it, would you like tea or coffee now? ""The food was a hit or miss. Some dishes tasted fine and some, like the salads were dry, partially bitter, had odd vegetable cuts and no dressing was provided. Very substandard. That was all tolerable. However, the worst is saved for the last. Please do not choose ANY AIRLINE flying through Jeddah. Most flights are served not by an airbridge, but by bus. There were many folks who needed assistance to carry bags downstairs. It was tough on them. The airport was a throw back to a poor third world airport from the 60s or 70s. It was basically a giant building to herd people in. Transit passengers have to pass through two security checks, once when getting into the waiting area and once when getting ready to board the bus back to the airplane. The duty free areas are well stocked with perfume to last till the end of times! However that was the past of the airport that I routinely found myself in as it stank to high heaven. People were sleeping across benches, laying across floors. Masses of folks just struggling to bide the time. The wifi service was abysmally woeful. I couldn't even send a WhatsApp text message... Let alone a call, without being bumped off the server. The airport was filthy. The men's room was worse than the worst Greyhound bus bathroom! There was urine on the floor right till the doorway of the airport. There wasn't place to enter. Just one bathroom just about the size of 15 by 30 feet to serve almost 3000 people and connecting flights! Safe to say that for the first the in my life I said I'd wait to use the airplane bathroom. It was the best feeling ever to leave the airport and be back in the bus to the airplane. Boy, was I glad to leave!Please do yourself a favor and stay away from Jeddah. Most third world countries have better facilities to offer. I'd rate the flight a 2.5 and since they only offered flights through Saudi Arabia, the Jeddah airport rating, a solid -2.5. Be forewarned. I never write reviews all that often and all those I have, have been to praise a great experience.

I have travelled on business class for over 15 years now and have never really asked for it as it is given or already on our seats. So a big disappointment here. The food is also not any special. Comparing with the other Middle Eastern airlines Saudia is probably the worst one. The lounge at Jeddah mediocre. Most terrible was our seats getting Downgraded on return flights back from Cairo to Islamabad due to which we were not allowed access to the lounge at Jeddah airport. We were told to get refund on arrival at Islamabad through our travel agent which has been more than three weeks and still not expedited.

518,saudia_airlines,Very good if all's fine,"Having read many negative reviews, I was sceptical flying Saudia for a recent vacation trip to Istanbul but the flight ticket was a good 30% cheaper than other airlines, so decided to take the chance. Pleasantly surprised with the larger than average leather economy seats that allows you to easily stretch your legs (and I'm 5ft 5) with even some space to spare. 3 meals were served from KL to Istanbul - 2 on the KL-Jeddah flight and 1 from Jeddah-Istanbul - and they were pretty tasty. There were remarks about dirty toilets on-board but I did not encounter that, even when the flight was full on the way back to KL. A basic kit of socks, toothbrush, comb was given along with earphones (which you could keep). Entertainment was not extensive but for someone who slept throughout most of my flights, good enough. The gripe that I had was the limited drinks served on board - a small bottle of water was given with the meal along with a cup of tea or juice, and unless you asked for another bottle, none will be served until the next meal which was many hours later. If you are a big water drinker, this might be annoying as no liquids were allowed to be checked into the flight at most of the terminals - they were taken away at the boarding gate right before you enter the plane. Did not interact much with the stewards/stewardesses so nothing to complain about here. Strange enough, I found a lot of passengers on Saudia taking other people's seats just to be close to their family members and the stewards did their best to rearrange everyone - it was annoying for me to watch this happen and I could understand the slight annoyance on the stewards' faces when they had to do it over and over again. In December 2019, we were still using the old Jeddah airport for transit and it was very crowded. Toilet was a little dirty and wet so you just do your thing quickly and leave. Insufficient seats for the number of people but for a short transit of 1.5 hours, it was fine. Coming back to Kuala Lumpur from Istanbul, the transit was in Riyadh and that was a much better transit area with pop up cafes and a duty free shop. Our luggages arrived at all our destinations with no glitches so thank goodness. Overall, Saudia is a very good flight to take when all's fine. It probably gets more chaotic with missed flights, major delays or what-not's - I was lucky not to have encountered any of those this time.","January 8, 2020",4,Date of travel: December 2019,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",4,3,4,4,4,3,5,3

When they are flying to/from a western country the service is much better and attendants are more polite. However, when flying to a developing country the attendants are not as polite. When traveling to Casablanca the airline attendant was disrespectful towards my family. When we were trying to stow our carry-on items the attendant told us to sit down, other passengers are waiting, we looked back there were two passengers who were behind us patiently waiting. She also said ""what"" to us a couple of times rather than a more polite word like excuse me. When I was handing her my garbage , she dropped it on me without an apology. In the flight from Paris to Jeddah to service was much better, but they did not give out kids kits although it is listed on their website under giveaways.

When we landed the airport was basically a shed. The washroom's were disgusting, the doors were partially destroyed and the people were sickening, they had no prayer rooms so the restrooms were filled with water on the floors. Then our trip to New York was fine but the food still tasted bad. The return flight was when we actually handled with the staff. First off, the airline company did not by any means contact us to tell us the flight was 4 hours delayed, the website that we booked our tickets from had to report it to us. We called the airline company asking them if they could do anything as it was our 25th Wedding anniversary and we had a party scheduled. They were so rude and spoke harshly. Then we asked them if they had a lounge as we had checked out. Normally airline companies offer one thing or the other. The only thing they offered us was PAIN. When we arrived at the airport, the people at the check in service were very very rude, they gave my son 2 passes instead of giving me one for Jeddah to Dubai. (We only found this after we reached Jeddah but the people at the transit could've found that out so that shows how irresponsible they are.) When we asked them to give us another boarding pass as we had to board in 5 minutes, they kept making us wait. I asked the guy at the counter to give me my boarding pass and gave me one of his pissed looks. He said next but I didn't move from there. I only left after he gave me my boarding pass.

So airline didn't bothered about the customers who suffered with cancellation neither made an arrangement so somehow to decrease the inconvenience caused by cancellation. Well she managed to spend the time at airport waiting for the next flight to London, which also got delayed nearly two hours, contacted customer services via their website on 28th Dec response was slow and the reply was ""standard"", which she received today 07:00. which wasn't of really any help.

Our experience was amazingly fabulous with this airline. The seats in the business class was comfortable, wide and converted to a flat bed. Once you enter the aircraft, one of the air stewardesses welcomes you and takes you to your seat. You are then offered the selection of juice or different types of delicious smoothies. This will be followed by the special Saudi coffee and 4 types of delicious dates. When flying the ""Dine on request"" menu will be on service. You select from different types of starters, main hot mel and sweets and fruits salad. What was amazing is the non-stop service of food and drinks tea and coffee by highly efficient aistewardesses with excellent communication skills and wide smile onm their face. We had today the amazing service by Rachelle who was full of energy and non-stop service enthusiasm. Praise also goes to the Service supervisor Ahmad who was in control and on the move continuously.

545,saudia_airlines,Worst possible service ever!,"If you are ever flying from USA to Bangladesh and thinking to take SAUDIA AIRLINES الخطوط السعودية , you should think twice. Experience: The flight from LAX to Jeddah was on time. However, the air hostesses were very unprofessional. They hardly attend your calls and sometimes simply cancel your call. They presume that you will walk to their kitchen and do self service. Their food was extremely good though.The transit at Jeddah airport was initially good. The airport looked decent and there is free Wifi. However, at some point, people come there at a huge number and you cannot even find a seat to sit on. Many people sit on the floor. Also you feel very insecured about your belongings. They have very few charging ports and only support UK plugs. Their restrooms are worse than any public washroom on roadside. The flight from Jeddah to Dhaka was delayed by 1 and half hours. When you board on, you will find some other people sitting on your designated seat and your overhead compartments are also full. It is very hard to deal with those people tbh to get your sit back. The air hostesses disappear at the back and you are at your own service. The front display panel was not functional, earphone jack was broken. Nice! They do not provide you any pillows or blankets. They served first meal or any drinks after 1.5 hours. After that, I slept and when I woke up, I was very thirsty. I pressed the call button and two air hostesses passed by me without even looking at me and cancelled the call. Then I called three more times and someone came, I asked for juice. She said, “I have pepsi. Please wait and I will be back.” Then I waited for 30 mins and she didn’t show up. After that, I went to the kitchen and saw that she was just sitting and gossiping with another air hostess. They told me we are preparing all the drinks. I said, “I asked you half an hour ago and you are still preparing! You yourself offered me Pepsi. How are you preparing that?” She just said sorry to me and gave me a glass of water. LOL. After two mins, she came to my seat and said, “Can you cancel the call now please?” I told her, “Do you know I am flying from US for 30+ hours and you are not even giving me a drop of water when I call you? Your preparation for juice will take 30 more mins and I have to wait for that? (30+30)! Then why did offer me pepsi, and then sit back and relax?” As soon as she heard that I am from USA, she started apologizing too much and immediately returned with a pepsi can and glasses. LOL again. I warned her to be more careful next time and she left saying sorry. Still lots of other people’s calls were left unattended because they do not really care about Bangladeshi worker people living at Saudi. Only when they know that you are a person from USA, they have the pepsi can ready for you. Clap.Finally, I would say, spend may be $100 or $200 more and get a better airlines.

547,saudia_airlines,Saudia should be banned from flying internationally via Jeddah...,"I never complain, but travelling via Jeddah was a total total disaster. I’m a young female travelling alone and I feel it necessary sharing my experience so that others won’t have to experience it. The flight from Dubai was disgusting- parents leaving screaming and shouting children to run in the aisles and kicking passengers’ chairs, while just turning a blind eye, I was stuck in my own personal hell... The food was very bad tasting and for drinks we had three options- water, tea or coffee. While exiting the plane, the floor was covered in garbage- passengers just throwing all their crap on the floor, even the containers in which dinner was served. Really a dirty lot of people. King Abdelaziz International Airport resembled something close to a war zone. The two officials on duty took a long time directing us because they were arguing amongst themselves in front of everyone. All females passengers had to go for a full body search in a dodgy looking room, while the men simply get to walk straight into the transit area. I’ve been to many places in my life, but never had I felt violated after a search at any airport. Transit is a big space filled with people everywhere. Due to a lack of seating, walking was a mission because the floor was covered in people sitting literally everywhere. Uncertain passengers got shouted at or ignored when asking for assistance from the airport staff. I didn’t even want to use the bathroom because the word filthy doesn’t do justice to the state its in. After what felt like hours, we boarded the plane for our 7 hour flight to JHB. There was NO inflight entertainment. NONE- not even a screen giving the flight progress info. The food was even worse than the first flight and this time even the cabin crew was rude.I honestly don’t know how travelling internationally from Riyadh is, but I will NEVER again travel on Saidia and I NEVER want to come anywhere near Jeddah! I have respect for all Muslim countries and have had great travels with all the other Gulf airlines, but I honestly feel that by the way people are treated at King Abdelaziz INTERNATIONAL airport, nobody is welcome there. Either they should stop all international flights or upgrade their facilities and staff’s attitude. This experience cost me more money because as soon as I reached JHB, I immediately booked I new return ticket to Dubai via Emirates airlines. At least I know I won’t feel scared and unsafe, I will be treated with respect and professionalism just as the leaders of the UAE promote their country’s services.

At arrival we (all the passengers transiting) were kept in a room for over an hour, with no explanation and with menacing soldiers and security personnel overseeing us.

605,saudia_airlines,Convenient direct flight,"Saudia Airlines is a convenient direct flight for South Africans traveling for Haj or Umrah, saving the trouble and hassles of a connecting flight. However, the staff are unfriendly and rude at times, most of the screens don't work properly (which is fine if you're traveling for haj or umrah you wont want to waste time on entertainment). Considering that the airline carries mostly Muslim passengers, they don't have a pipe or jug in the bathroom for washing or wudhu facilities. Also, the domestic aircraft's seem to be newer and much better than the international ones. So my bad experience goes like this - we're boarded the local flight from Madinah to Jeddah and were to have a 5 hour transit in Jeddah until we boarded the flight to Johannesburg. Upon boarding we had to leave the baby stroller at the entrance of the aircraft, we tried to explain (in English) that we require it at Jeddah airport as we'll be in transit. They rudely said we can collect it at the baggage belt. After taking our seats, we again asked the air hostess if we may take the stroller inside as we need it at Jeddah airport, she said she'll put a tag on it and it'll come out with the luggage at Jeddah airport. After awhile we asked her if she put a tag on the stroller, she irrtatedly said we shouldn't worry. Note that when checking in all the luggage the assistant didn't ask or give us tags for any of the hand luggage or the stroller. So Jeddah airport, after waiting about an hour or so at the luggage belt without any luck, we enquired at the counter, they said they will try to track it if we can wait for a further half an hour. Without any trace of the stroller, they said it might've been sent onto the Johannesburg flight already and we should receive it in Johannesburg. When arriving in Johannesburg, all the other passengers strollers were lying at the exit of the plane, our nowhere to be found. The assistant said if it was with the luggage it should be at the fragile belt. After wasting a further hour or so at the fragile belt, nothing was to be found.

616,saudia_airlines,"Faulty Earphones, Entertainment Units, Air-Conditioner & Sink! Terrible Customer Service from the Crew!","It was my 1st time flying with Saudia Airlines. I did not have a choice as it was under a pilgrimage Hajj package which I had bought from MKM Travel Agency. I was so disappointed & angry as it was such a bad experience flying with Saudi Airlines, both ways. On our way to Jeddah International Airport, we were given earphones for the entertainment unit. Both my mother’s & mine were faulty. I had returned them both to the stewardess & requested for a new one. The stewardess looked upset & harassed regarding the simple request. She replied that she will try to find one that is “working.” It was a long wait before we finally got a new set. Unfortunately, the new set of earphones were also faulty. Either that or the entertainment unit was busted. We could watch the movies but without any audio. When I explained to the stewardess about our predicament, she just shrugged & left without any solution or apology! It was just so horrible. We were on an 8-hour flight with no entertainment though we’ve paid good money for it. Our 2nd experience was on a flight back home to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was worse than our 1st trip. The same thing happened. Faulty earphones or entertainment units. The stewardess was not at all apologetic. Instead, she just ignored us completely. That seems to be their SOP when presented with a problem. Another pressing issue was the air-conditioning in the plane. All of us were sweating profusely since we stepped into the plane. When asked why it was so, no answer nor apology was given! We were only told to be patient & that in time, the temperature will be lower. The temperature did drop but only after a few hours of bathing in your own sweat! Furthermore, we had to deal with the faulty sink in the lavatory! It was so disgusting. The water would not drain out from the sink. I alerted the steward who was quick to attend to the problem. Unfortunately, the lavatory was then out of use for an hour. How can a commercial flight be given the “green light” to fly when it has so many issues baffles me til this day. I presumed no maintenance or proper checks were carried out before take-off. The food provided on-board was just average. Consistency was also not part of their culture. Fruit juices were served in a full cup (not even glass!) to some while others only received half a cup. The bun which was given to me had accidentally dropped. The right thing to do would be to give me another. Instead, the stewardess said that she will give me another later as she had run out of buns. Later never came & I didn’t get my bun. This is by far the worst airline. Stay away from this terrible airline as they are very irresponsible & unapologetic. There is no sense of urgency, responsibility or accountability. The stewardesses’ were disrespectful & oblivious to the comfort of its passengers. I am even inclined to believe that they are racist just from the way they act, react & serve their passengers.

So when I got the chance to upgrade my flight on Saudia for a reasonable price (1000SR extra pp one way), I took it. I must say, it made a big difference. On that sector, Saudia fly their Airbus A320-214 which looks like a new airplanes with luxurious seats that turn into a flatbed. The new entertainment system is excellent with plenty of choices to choose from. The staff are very well trained, and professional. They also started having chefs on board to prepare the meals upon request. Our meals were really good with variety of options that are presented beautifully. Each guest in business class get a amenity kit with all needed skincare products, eye mask, sucks, dental kit, etc. We needed to get some sleep, but in the same time, we wanted to soak up the experience as much as we can. We tried to have it both ways, and I think we found the needed balance.Saudia has a long way before becoming a recognizable player on the global travel market, but for us the citizens of Saudi Arabia and even the residents and visitors of the country, I think Saudia should no longer be a second choice when it comes to flying out or back to Saudi Arabia.","September 18, 2019",5,Date of travel: August 2019,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4
619,saudia_airlines,Once you are in the air everything is fine!,"This was my fourth flight with Saudia in a week and the worst experience of them all! My first flight from Manchester to Jeddah was very pleasant, the flight left on time, the aircraft was modern and comfortable and the crew were polite and efficient. Even the food was better than average. I had an internal flight from Jeddah to Riyadh which was bit crazy, but typical of internal shuttle flights. My flight from Riyadh to Cairo was uneventful and again comfortable aircraft and friendly crew.It was my return from Cairo via Jeddah that things started to go downhill. The queue to check-in took exactly ONE HOUR! I appeared to be the only person with only one suitcase, everyone else seemed to have at least 3-4 and and 10/12 was not uncommon. Obviously this on its own adds to the delay. There were about eight check-in desks open but they were all dealing with three different flights. also once the queue got near the desks it split up into multiple queues behind each desk. So if the person at the front of your queue stood arguing with the staff for ten minutes then too bad. Once I actually got to the front of the queue the person at the desk took little more than a minute to check me in. Then there was another wait of about 30 minutes to go through immigration, but again that was not Saudia's fault.Boarding started promptly and once on the plane all was calm and yet another very pleasant flight.On arrival at Jeddah you get a bus to the transit 'lounge'. Your boarding pass is checked and you have to put your bag though an x-ray machine before going through yet another x-ray and security check. As you go through the door after the first x-ray machine there are toilets to the left. I strongly recommend you use those before heading through the main security. After security there is smallish duty free shop before you enter the hell on Earth that is the transit 'lounge'! The best thing about this space is that it has a Baskin & Robbins ice cream counter (among other food outlets). Considering how wealthy Saudi Arabia is, this 'lounge' is an embarrassment! Jeddah airport in general is poor at best, but the transit 'lounge' takes things down to whole new level. My total stopover time was about three hours so actually only spent about two hours in the lounge and that was long enough. How people survive in there for eight hours or more is beyond me. For the Manchester flight I had to go through yet another security check and thought I should use the toilet before joining the very slowly moving queue. I got about three steps inside the toilet before deciding I would rather wet myself than use it.When we eventually boarded the plane the calmness returned and ye another very pleasant flight with more above average food.On arrival at Manchester airport I had to wait 40 minutes for my bags to arrive. There were so many bags that they filled one complete luggage belt with apparently 300 more bags still to unload. It was only after someone had the brainwave of using two luggage belts that things started moving.So, to summerise I would happily recommend Saudia again, but never want to experience Jeddah transit lounge again!","September 17, 2019",4,Date of travel: September 2019,Yorkshire,4,5,5,4,3,5,5,5

To begin with executives of Saudia at Delhi check in counter have no knowledge of various Visa rules. They delayed my checking in, even though I had a 5 year Multiple entry Schenegen Business visa. The person at the counter kept on rubbing the visa page with his thumb, as if it was a scratch and win coupon. Finally his supervisor contacted someone who gave a go ahead. These executives, have all their lives, checked in Hajis into Jeddah and back. Connecting flight to Europe with a Schenegen visa is an new experience to them.At Jeddah airport South Terminal the transit lounge is the size of a big restaurant, jam packed with thousands of passengers screaming at each other, children running around and rest room worst than a Indian Railway Passenger train. On top of that the blaring PA system inflicts pain to your ears. I had accepted an 8 hour layover (cheap ticket) hoping I will get a pod or an airport hotel to sleep. Nothing of the sorts.

The air conditioner is set at 17 Celsius (freezing) whereas outside temperature is 34.In the morning, an arrogant officer again rubbed before he allowed me to board my flight to Geneva, with utter disbelief written on his face, that I could also travel to Switzerland. I must admit that flight took off on time and landed on the dot at Geneva, thanks to expat pilots that Sadia has recruited.On the way back I was detained at Geneva airport by an arrogant lady executive of SWISS, working for Saudia, because I had a 12 and half hour of layover and it was exceeding the approved transit time by 30 minutes. I said, ""it is your airlines which issued me the ticket."" She had no answer. Again the supervisor spoke to someone and got the clearance.Online travel portals, often uses algorithm to get you a cheap ticket, without factoring the layover time and comfort (or lack of it). So come what may, avoid flying Saudia, if you value your time and self esteem. Pay a little more and get any other middle east airlines, such Emirates, Qatar, Etihaad or even Kuwait.","September 14, 2019",3,Date of travel: September 2019,"New Delhi, India",3,2,2,2,3,2,2,1

According to my initial reservation and confirmation in 8th August, flight was from Jeddah to Riyadh with 2h 45m Connection time, and from Riyadh to Sri Lanka at from 7:25 onward arrival at Sri Lanka at 17:15. Initially it was fine for me, but after payment and reservation. next day I received massage from Saudia Airline that flight schedule changed. Departure from Jeddah is same, arrival to Riyadh as it was, but from Riyadh instead of 7:25 it became 09:30 and arrival time to Sri Lanka is 19:20 instead of 17:15. Until here I feel that it's Ok, I am on holiday mode.... so no problem if flights changes or delay. But what next is interesting.....When I reached Riyadh.... I was not able to find SV788 flight to Sri Lanka on airport flight information, it was showing SV788 to Maldives. I asked information about my connection flight, unfortunately they were totally ignorant of what is happening. The guy said, might possible Saudia Airline send you message on your mobile about flight cancellation or changes of time. It made me more confused...... I ran to Saudi Airline counter and got informed, that your flight is going to Sri Lanka but via Maldives with 1h stay over... My concern is why not mentioning on their website, so passengers get informed prior to make reservation.......","September 10, 2019",3,Date of travel: August 2019,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",2,4,4,4,3,4,4,4

During the 24 hours waiting time they didn't try to arrange a flight to Trivandrum or they didn't provide any food , water to all these passengers. They behavior was very irresponsible. They didnt show any sort of kindness to passengers who paid a big amount for their travel. They purposefully forget that they have this jobs only because of these fellow passengers . They ignored passengers problems and difficulties just like that even in this calamity situation. They just need money.

685,saudia_airlines,No respect for Non-saudi nationals!,"Me and my girlfriend had a horrid time dealing with Saudi. Regarding the outbound journey our 3 bags never turned up at CMB, it arrived 5 days late with mine covered in bird excrement, no compensation was provided with empty apologies.Our flights itself were acceptable in terms of comfortability, however on our return flight my girlfriend had to ask for a pillow on three different occasions and the final time the attendant lied and said there was none. A few moments later a Saudi national asked for a pillow and she was given one immediately. I kicked up a fuss and then we were given one and I was told I never asked for one.Furthermore, our bags were also lost on the return flight, and it has not been returned to us or tracked. I noticed that on both occasions our bags were lost/misplaced, at least 5 to 8 other people were missing theirs. I also noticed that none of them were Saudi nationals, all of them were from different countries and spoke another language. I don't want to throw around the racism card loosely but it happening twice in similar circumstances causes me to think there is potentially some planning behind what bags get left behind. Other reviewers on tripadvisor felt the same way, so it isn't exactly a rare occurrence.Customer service is non-existent, its sole purpose is to redirect you to their complaint forms online, which aren't user friendly at all and are a massive inconvenience. The complaint process is a massive loophole designed to force you to give up on goal of getting compensation.I advise strongly, if you are not a Saudi national, you will experience some or many issues. You may take the flight and experience no problems whatsoever but be warned this is an airline that is notorious for hiding their faults.

I was a bit apprehensive after reading earlier reviews but we had absolutely no issues. Seats were allocated as we had selected, luggage transfer was smooth, good friendly crew and nice in flight entertainment options including Indian stuff. The real positives are the great leg space in the economy class, real affordable prices, good food - the kids were thrilled with the pampering of goodie bags, juice, ice cream and chocolates. We had asked for Asian Vegetarian food which was duly provided.On the flipside while the food was tasty, in some flights the quantity of the main meal was slightly less. But the hostess were kind enough to provide us with an additional meal from the other optionsYes the transit airports in Riyadh and Jeddah would not rank as the best in class. Especially Jeddah being a small terminal, it can get crowded with limited food options - so preferable to transit through Riyadh and minimize the transit time in Jeddah. But it is definitely not something which is not bearable for a few hours. I understand that a large new terminal is coming up in Jeddah soon which should hopefully be much better.

692,saudia_airlines,The worst flight,"Probably one of my worst decisions to take Saudia flight from Dubai to Paris via Jeddah. The flight was an hour late from Dubai, but we didn’t know it was the beginning of the worst journey. Reached Jeddah and the horror started. One table for transfer passengers who were checking the flights and stamping the boarding passes. No separate line for travellers with children, or old travellers. All have to stand in one line which was being served by two personnels only. From there, you go upstairs and FIRST get your bags through the security machine after a few steps, you again put your bags through the security check and pass through the security gate, 2 security machines at a distance of hardly 30-40 steps for the same thing, doesn’t make any sense. Then you enter the terminal and you find it over crowded. The terminal is not clean and the worst part is the toilets. Men have 3-4 toilets and probably the same for women. The toilets are super dirty, the water is spilled on the floor, people queued up infront of the toilets, dirty water splashing on their clothes. Its better to hold up if you have a flight in couple of hours. Anyhow, since we got delayed at Dubai so our transfer time was hardly one hour and thirty minutes and most of the time was spent while getting our boarding passes stamped and going through the security. Now comes the second “interesting” part, we board the plane at designated time and the flight is ready to take off at departure time, the aircraft doors are locked and secured and then we wait for another 2 hours inside the plane for take off. The crew has no idea why we are not taking off, the only reason told is “Air traffic control has not given us the clearance to fly”, apparently, upon reaching Paris, I find out that the same night there was another attack at Abha airport and probably due to that, they stopped the air traffic for a couple of hours. So, we reach Paris two hours late. Keep waiting for our luggage and that wait lasts for next 48 hours, YES, you read it right. Our luggage (not even a single pc.) including our baby’s stroller does not arrive. The airport staff does not have any idea about it. They just take a report and tells us to talk to SAUDIA staff outside the terminal. When we go to Saudia office outside the terminal, the staff there tells us, they have nothing to do with the luggage, they are just a reservation and ticketing office of a third party, working for Saudia. The next day, we had a journey to Netherlands and we reach there, still no luggage. A day after (as mentioned after 48 hours) we receive our luggage and finally manage to do our stuff. Fortunately, the flight back was OK, but again upon arrival in Dubai, our baby stroller does not arrive and we receive it after 24 hours of our arrival in Dubai. Those of you, who want their friends and family suffer, please get them a SAUDIA ticket. You may find it cheaper but at a cost of mental stress. For me, I am not traveling by Saudia any more. Still trying to contact Saudia for the claim of necessary items I bought, but no response from them yet.","July 13, 2019",1,Date of travel: July 2019,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2,1,1,2,3,1,4,3

737,saudia_airlines,Avoid Saudia's indifference and lost luggage - much better off with Emirates or Qatar,"This was my first, and hopefully last, trip with Saudia Airlines. I traveled for work in business class from Geneva to Manila with a stopover in Jeddah. The check in at GVA was OK but the staff were not very friendly. In-flight was also OK - not as comfortable as Emirates or Qatar - but the attitude of the staff was noticeably marginal... not really interested in doing their jobs it seemed. Then Jeddah Airport - and the Business lounge there - are way below the standard set by Doha and Dubai. Worst part was that when I got to Manila my luggage wasn't there... in fact none of the passengers who came to MNL through Jeddah on a Saudia flight from Europe had their luggage arrive in MNL. I guess they just forgot to load that crate (even though I had a 3 hour layover, so it certainly wasn't due to lack of time). My luggage did arrive in MNL the following evening, but I had to go into work meeting earlier in the day inappropriately dressed (my bad for not carrying a suit on board I guess). Afterwards Saudia sent me an email to take a 'satisfaction survey' but when I tried to open the link (several different times) it doesn't work... classic... just like the airline itself. So when I sum it all up - a Business class trip with indifferent staff, very poor Business lounge in Jeddah, and lost luggage that could have affected my trip outcomes, I will try to avoid Saudia in the future. I have flown Emirates and Qatar many times and have only had positive experiences with those two.","June 27, 2019",1,Date of travel: June 2019,"Perth, Australia",4,1,4,3,4,2,1,2

749,saudia_airlines,...it appears that flying domestically in KSA is still a very challenging process from start to end...,"Saudia Airlines is the national airline of Saudi Arabia. I took a domestic flight last week and it was simply ‘horrible’ as our flight left over an hour late and mind you the flight was only 1 hour and 10 minutes in duration! They are still using the busses in Jeddah Airport to take you to the aircraft which is really a killer during the summer as the temperature was 45 C or about 113 F. OK, the busses were air-conditioned, but you must exit the bus and climb the stairs to the aircraft and coming from an air-conditioned bus to the hot tarmac is a real killer. Most important for me is the comfort and service during the flight. The seats in Business Class were very comfortable and there was ample leg space. They initially gave us a selection of canned juices and then that was followed by their date and Arabic Coffee service. After this the service was completely to the bare minimum as our entire request for the attendant/service light was completely ignored. There was no food service even though we could smell food being heated yet all I wanted was a cup of tea. The teas never came as they were very inattentive and were paying little attention to the passengers in Business Class. When we finally arrived to our destination it took over one hour for the luggage to clear the single conveyor belt.

754,saudia_airlines,Good service but really bad transit airport!!!!!,"On a positive note, they checked every passenger including the hand luggage once again before boarding the aircraft!! it did make you feel even more safer. They served 2 warm meals both very tasty for airline food and substantial. I actually didn't manage to finish either. Also they offered unlimited soft drinks and tea/coffee. Unfortunately, the toilets were the worst I have EVER experienced in an airline. It had nothing to do with the staff as they kept cleaning but the passengers who didn't know anything about personal hygiene or respect for others. Jeddah airport is the worst!!! There is only one toilet for women and that was beyond dirty. I was terrified any thing in the airport would touch any part of my body!!! But they did have comfortable chairs for us to relax. Unfortunately, no priority pass lounge either. The second leg of our journey which was from Jeddah to Colombo was AMAZING!!! The service was impeccable. It felt like we were in first class. Of course there were only a few passengers but the toilets were super clean and the food was amazing...... YES I would fly Saudia again - this has everything to do with their attitude and the service. Just need to have a way to keep the toilets clean for longer journeys and perhaps improve facilities at the Jeddah airport, even for a fee.","June 9, 2019",4,Date of travel: May 2019,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5

Weeks before I already asked for wheelchair service for my parents since they can’t walk much from check-in to boarding gates. Our flight from Mallorca to Jeddah was fine but what a let down when we arrived to Jeddah airport. Assistance was snobbish and careless to awful. My mother had to walk upon arrival to the boarding area and service was so careless. They just left my Parents unattended in the middle of the crowd and nobody assisted them to the boarding gate. The airport toilets were super dirty and stinky.Upon boarding the flight was ok until we reached our seats near the smelly toilets.It was the worst flight we had.The aircraft is so dated they had to put handwritten labels on tapes.Entertainment service was broken on the whole flight, 9 hours flight to Manila was exhausting and the only thing I had in mind was “this Airline Company is the WORST & UNWORTHY to fly with.This was my first time to fly with SAUDIA AIRLINES.

I have never ever had one, just one, good experience with this “airline”. I don’t know anyone who likes this airlines (we are saudi), but I still decided to give it one more chance due to them claiming they “improved”. I ended up with lost luggage, a broken chair, rude flight attendance, and a bad experience/start to my vacation. Just to show you how bad this airlines is, even if I were to travel within the Saudi Arabia I actually take an international flight and transit just to go from one city to the other in Saudi to avoid using this “airlines”. Even the airlines itself knows it’s the worst because if you happen to call their unified number the first thing on the list is directing the call to complaints. It truly saddens me as a Saudi Arabian female to write/admit this but I’m just writing the truth: Saudi Airlines is the WORST AIRLINES.

Unfortunately, AirFrance discontinued flights into Saudia Arabia in January 2019, so the only way to get in and out of KSA and collect points is through Saudia Airlines. It's becoming increasingly difficult to find flights to major hubs, and there are usually additional stops now in Jeddah or Damman. I would say delays are quite common on Saudia, so I'm usually worried about landing in time for connecting flights. The food is horrendous, the children run wild in the aisles, and ""beverage service"" consists of maybe one bottle of water during a 7 hour flight. One other unfortunate thing is that seats are either ""economy"" or ""business"". Most other airlines offer premium economy, so you can have a little extra room and nicer amenities without having to pay outrageous prices. All in all, probably my 2nd least favorite airline (Flynas being the worst).

The staff promised assistance to show us the way and get through security, but nobody showed up.- The luggage did not get to the new flight in time. Our suitcases are still somewhere in Jeddah and still have to be sent to our home in Belgium.- It is the first time that I have experienced that Economy can board first and Business Class only afterwards.- The Business Class seats were very bad: * No storage possibility for personal items (amenity kit, glasses, ...) * Insufficient space to lie flat with both legs. One foot was possible in the narrow hole, the other not. * No space in the width: arms had to hang over the edge.- That there are no alcoholic drinks available on a flight from Saudia, can be explained, although it was a disappointment considering the price that we paid.- I received 1 glass of still water without additional question for my wishes and that was it with it for the next 5 hours. At other companies there is always a bottle of water for the night.- The food menu chart did mention soft drinks, but they were not offered.- After dinner, I didn't get a question about whether I wanted coffee or tea.- The food was also a disappointment: * The starter with seafood contained some very dry shrimps, a salad that was too hard to bite and bread that was probably several days old. * I therefore refused the main course.- The toilets were dirty.

When i mentioned this to the cabin staff they happily reacted by saying that once flight is landed we shall call the maintenance but to my surprise initially they tried themselves with all the efforts to retrieve the pods immediately after the landing of the flight.The efforts they put in cannot be expressed by words.It took nearly 45 mins for them to get the pods out and all the crew members gracefully waited for the job to be completed whereas all the passengers were deplaned.It wud have been easy for anyone to simply say that no we cannot remove it but the efforts of the crew members especially the business cabin crew where so courteous and graceful that i cannot expressed myself for the efforts they put in for such a small things.Thank you Team Saudia SV773.It has been a memorable journey with you and learnt some good things about how to be patient even for the smallest of the things.Appreciated from my hearth and henceforth shall always travel by saudia for all my travel needs in the kingdom CheersLiyakat Hafiz,"April 12, 2019",5,Date of travel: April 2019,"Maharashtra, India",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

817,saudia_airlines,Marred by ground facilities and online system,"This is our first experience with Saudia Airlines. We read that the Chairman was putting in efforts to raise Saudia to rival Emirates and Qatar Airways so we decided to fly Saudia from Singapore to Cairo via Jeddah.The flight itself was ok. The food and movie choice were decent, The Dreamliner aircraft used was comfortable and the cabin service, while not exactly up to SIA's standard, was nonetheless, efficient in spite of the full load of passengers, most of them heading to Jeddah for the umrah. The free wifi connection to send/receive texts was a bonus.Here's the not so good parts. The transfer airport at Jeddah operated by Saudia was too small to handle the number of passengers. It was about the size of a bus station. There were more people standing because of the lack of seats. You would not use the toilets more than once because they were very filthy and wet. Saudia did not announce the departure gate until 10 minutes before departure, resulting in a rush of people to the gate.For our return flight, we received a message to bid online for an upgrade to Business Class. We were successful in our bid but their system somehow charged only 5 paxs instead of 6 paxs in our group. We then tried another credit card. This time their system charged only 3 paxs. Both times, my credit card/banks confirmed that the 2 cards were charged and that there was no issue with the cards and credit limits. When we called Saudi Airlines office in Cairo to check the status - (after being charged 8 paxs when we had only 6) - we were pushed from pillar to post - with the final advice to check with Saudia office at Jeddah Airport. When we reached Jeddah, we went through another round of pillar to post and finally ended up with the person in charge of Departure Gate 9. To his credit, he did make some calls and repeated the same thing - no upgrade reflected on their system. So we flew home on economy class. Their online system certainly sucked. Even when I tried to manage my booking online, the 2FA authentication by way of SMS or email at times took up to half a day to reach my mobile!!! Finally, as if to rub salt into the wound, I received a text from Saudia to inform me that my upgrade bid was unsuccessful. But we were already at 35000 feet in the air flying back to Singapore. A bit late wasn't it!With this experience, we definitely think it will be a very long time before Saudia can rival Emirates or Qatar Airways, if at all. Flying with an airline is not just about the flight and onboard service but the entire experience.

829,saudia_airlines,Much better than expected,"Before the trip I red from few sources that the Airline is so, so, that the servise is pour, that all together it is not very nice airline. With that in mind I boarded my first flight from Khartoum to Riyadh. It was a middle of the night flight so I thought, fine, I will doze and somehow survive. My surprise was great when I was greeted at the door with the smiling crew. The same crew was trying to overdo each other helping the passengers during the flight of 2.5 hours. There were drinks/water served all the time + lovely meal, even in the Economy. Original, tasty, nicely served. Way better than I ever experienced in any European or North American Airline. The seats were tight like everywhere else but not tighter. The design of the cabin very practical and spacious under the limited possibilities. Than I had 5 hours wait in Riyadh. I was leaving for London from the same terminal, I believe no. 1, very pleasant bright clean area. My only complaint would be a lack of restaurant. I came across 2 small coffee places with limited amount of breakfast items. My next flight with Saudia to London - Heathrow was even better than the first. The lunch was much better than middle of the night meal from Khartoum. Looks like this airline has broken away from ghastly “airplane food” and served hearty tasty nourishment as well as wide selection of non alcoholic drinks. I was impressed when the crew responded to my complaint about poorly functioning entertainment screen. They tried fo fix it but when it failed they took seat number and other info, and made sure I was able to watch movies on the neighbouring seat as it was empty. Also at one of the flights I had a seat back to the toilet block. Could not hear anything. As a matter of fact I didn’t hear it at all. Impeccable service can be added to the pile of superlatives.

However, the return leg was also pretty good as I flew back from ISB to VIE.The 77W on return leg was HY-AK25, a relatively newer one than the one I flew on inbound. This plane had working IFE with good content although I am never intrigued by IFE aboard planes. WIFI was working this time but did not work for first 1 hour of the flight. The food was filling but as usual again rice stuff. The seats on this 777 were far better because it was in 3-3-3 layout (last time we had 3-4-3). Naturally this meant wider seat. Entire flight was pretty smooth, on time departure, nice crew. No issues there.Transit in Riyadh was nearly 8 hours. We took Alfursan lounge which was good too. This was the only negative of booking with Saudia - too long transit.Flight from Riyadh was via Jeddah to Vienna. The snacks served on RUH-JED were too dry. The food was again the rice which I was already fed up of. The flight was again in time and arrive on time.Overall I would say to skeptical people to ignore any outdated reviews about Saudia. It gets you from point 1 to point 2 in low price and not so fancy stuff. The planes condition can be unexpected as their fleet is a mixture of older and newer planes.

Well, like other first line air dont expect they will come for service every time u turn on service light. In flight entertainment is good enough and updated recent movies. They wont serve occational snacks, so u can bring own snacks/foods which are allowed in airlines. Airports -Neither Riyadh or Jeddah have wifi. Haven’t seen any sleeper chair in Riyadh, saw some in Jeddah. Charging stations everywhere.. (Bring converter if device Doesn't fit saudi power Outlet system). Riyadh have mcdonalds, Burger kings etc, haven’t seen that in Jeddah south terminal. Plenty of places for prayer and plenty of empty chairs for rest. Airport Staffs maybe a little lazy side sometime, example - they forgot my mom had a flight to catch and left. Later she had to shout and gather staffs otherway would have missed plane. I would recommend Saudi air for the price, my mom travelled to Washington in december (with wheelchair) and in flight staffs were really helpfull. So, I booked Saudi again travelling to Washington DC on March. If you looking to save some, go for it - it wont give u premium service like Singapore or Emirates - but gets the work done.

876,saudia_airlines,"Airline operations are fine, Jeddah Airport is filthy. Avoid at all costs","Avoid the Jeddah Airport at all costs! It is the worst experience I have ever had. I read somewhere after this trip that it was rated the worst airport in the world, and it did not disappoint. I booked a round trip flight from IAD to Sharm El Sheik (SSH) for a scuba diving trip through Delta using its partner Saudia Airlines, leaving 24 January. I would have thought that Delta, as a founding member of the SkyTeam, would investigate the airlines that it allows to enter the club. It is apparent that someone was asleep at the switch when Delta let Saudia into your club. The airline itself is well run in terms of flight operations and service. However, it’s major hub in Jeddah is a disgrace. As a hub for Saudia Airlines, many of the flights have extremely long layovers – my flight to SSH had a 4 hour layover and my return flight to IAD on February 2-3 had a 9.5 hour layover. Long layovers don’t bother me, but in this case the airport terminal is extremely crowded – you can’t leave your seat or you will lose it. It is extremely noisy with an inadequate PA system that continuously blares announcements at a loud decibel level. Last, but not least, the biggest problem is the toilet facilities, or better put, lack of them. They have no toilets in the terminal that a man can sit - only a porcelain hole in a tight compartment that is wet and filthy. Plans for a modern facility are at least 6 years away according to Saudia website, assuming no delays in construction and design.Had I known there were no toilet facilities in the hub terminal during these long layovers I would never have booked a flight through Jeddah. When I checked in for my return flight on 2 February at the SSH Airport I was issued a pass by Saudia Airlines to the only lounge in the terminal, in recognition of my elite status with Delta. I didn’t ask for the pass but was appreciated the courtesy because of the long layover. However, when I went to the lounge in Jeddah I was told by the Saudi representative at the desk that the pass that Saudia Airlines agent in SSH had issued was no good because I was flying economy. The pass was handwritten by a Saudia agent – he knew my status and where I was going and even wrote the flight number and confirmation number on the pass. But the Saudia people in Jeddah were rude and discourteous. As a result, I got to spend over 9 hours in a filthy, crowded airport with no adequate toilet facilities. I really didn’t enjoy trying to have a bowel movement standing over a 12” diameter pot, hoping that my aim was good, knowing I would have to have a quick bowel movement in order to not lose my seat in the terminal..This wasn’t just a bad day but a daily experience with the crowded conditions and absence of toilets in a major airport hub. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest nations in the world, and should provide a reasonably functioning hub terminal with a toilet you can sit on to relieve yourself. Don't go through Jeddah ir your layover is going to be a long one. And even if it's a short layover, take a trip to the toilet before you land.","February 5, 2019",2,Date of travel: February 2019,,4,3,4,2,4,3,1,2

885,saudia_airlines,Worst Airline I ever had. Shame on Saudi Arabia,"First of all the service within the planes was ok and the choice of films as well.But here it starts: On some places the screens didn't work. So on mine. Luckily I had my own tablet with predownloaded films and headphones.But the worst was still yet to come:That airport in Jeddah. I never experienced any shittier than that.Firstly: they placed a check just anywhere in the airport. After this a second check, where you had to take of your shoes and had to go barefeet on the obviosly dirty floor. That finished I went to the toilets. Absolutely shocking! Old, damaged and dirty. The urinals were not working, so everyone had to go to the ""normal"" toilets. Something like water on the whole floor and faecals here and there.Even on my return, three weeks later, the urinals were still defect.After this I entered a big waiting hall. one feels like cattles waiting for being transported. Far not enough seats for the amount of passengers.Asking for the lounge, I was rudely dismissed for some stupid reason. They didn't even offer any price.The screens often didn't show the correct gate, Even if it was shown, it was often wrong. The wifi didn't work. In this airport nothing works!Even third world countries have far, far better airports. If this Airport displays Saudi Arabia as a country, then better never ever enter.I rather pay more than ever flying with them again and whom ever asks for my advise, I tell them never go with saudi air.

889,saudia_airlines,Negative reviews are exaggerated,"I was hesitant to book Saudia because of lot of negative reviews, both from words of mouth and internet reviews. Nevertheless I gave it a try and my summary of review is that negativity about this airline is very much exaggerated.I booked from Vienna to Islamabad, for half the price I paid with another middle eastern carrier around 1.5 years ago (even though I booked 3 days before that time, still the difference is massive when you take into account the time and currency depreciation).I got a very decent baggage of 23+23 kg on supersaver. The first plane was 6.5 year old A320. Economy seats were a pleasant surprise. They had good leg room with pillows and quilt provided. The plane wasnt fully loaded so I had three seats besides me free. The plane left the gate in time but was delayed 30 mins due to de-icing. Drinks were served in less than 1 hour into flight. The crew was nice (mostly men - unusual to see). The food was ok, nothing special. On both legs they served the same thing, with small changes to dessert and salad. Food is where they can improve, but what was provided was okay.I purchased wifi voucher but the 77W I got on next leg was not having it. The transit in Riyadh was 5 hours (7 hours going to be on way back). The airport was okay, not as bad as Jeddah (which I kept on being advised to stay away from). The currency exchange was available easily. There were Burger King, Dominos and some coffee shops.Overall I think for the price I paid for flying with Saudia, I was satisfied. They took me to my destination in time, planes were in good condition (contrary to many people's opinion which I think is outdated - as SV has modernized its fleet a lot already). Food could improve but I would be ok with what they served. IFE I dont review because for me this is a non issue when choosing airline. On A320, no IFE. On 77W there were screens but non functional.","January 27, 2019",4,Date of travel: January 2019,"Vienna, Austria",4,3,5,2,5,2,5,5

A very comfortable flight, nice range of food on offer and treated very nicely by the Air Stewards. Hence having said all that this was the flight out from London - Jeddah, but coming back was absolute chaotic...…….No wheelchairs allowed. We 'had' to pay approx. £15 to have the wheelchair wrapped and included in with the baggage. We were made to literally drag and hold up, by her arms,our mother part way to the plane...…around 50-100m. We are talking about a wheel chair bound lady! Also at check-in desk a young guy gave us hell and held us there for over one hour whilst he investigated an insignificant 'smudge' on my mothers passport. The guy really thought he was onto something (we are talking about a 84 year old woman here!) although we hold British passports and travelling Business Class the guy called around 5 other officers who all scrutinised her passport. Finally got resolved after they called British Passport Control at Heathrow who verified legitimacy. They looked stupid and allowed us through.....absolute idiots. Flight was good on the way back. But experience at the check-in desk left a bitter taste. My mother was petrified cause she had heard about the terrible treatment carried out by the Saudi Officials to travellers on even a whim or slightest suspicion. She kept asking ""is everything ok?"".

The food was absolutely horrid and the air hostess serving us was so rude and passive aggressive. She told us the food item we wanted had ran out as we were seated at the back and she gave us another item from the mains which we couldn't eat as was inedible to be honest - which was the case both ways. But the return trip was worse from RUH to LHR. The air hostess saw me and my husband hadnt touched our food and she didn't even bother asking if we would like anything else to eat, whereas the gentleman in front was asked and was given the main which we were told had ran out! She had so much attitude that if I had the energy she would be told where to go. However we were both so tired and we were also both unwell and weren't catered to at all nor were cared for. I am sure they are always taught to cater well for the passengers and make it easy for them on the flight - which we didn't get. The only upside is that they have a prayer area - the only reason I give 1 rating.

The seats in business class did not recline all the way. Some of the TV's were not working despite bring reset many times by the cabin crew. They were short on the complementary children's packs that are supposed to be given on each flight. The crew discouraged us from using the business class toilet, probably because they felt we will be in their way and we were told to use the economy toilets. Food was average, and most of the time if you are sitting in the second half of the business class cabin, by the time the air hostesses get to you, the nicer foods are unavailable, so they only stock a few of each menu items. HOWEVER, the Jeddah to Madinah flight (only 1 hour!) Was a totally different experience. We were given a much better plane and excellent business class service. They obviously send their older planes to Africa (maybe because they think 3rd world countries won't expect much, even in business class!!)

904,saudia_airlines,Long haul flights - Poor connections,"Quite skeptical prior to booking as all positive reviews were only for business class travellers and not economy. My flight was from Manchester UK to Hyderabad India, connecting via Jeddah. I booked the flight with only 3 hour wait time considering I was travelling with a child. Having checked the flight three hours before flying the connecting flight was changed with no notification, so I am left with 10 hours wait instead of 3, I spoke to the airline they said I can cancel the flight which was not practical. I asked information about lounge they said enquire in the airport.The flight Manchester to Jeddah: The flight was good, reasonable leg room, decent food, good entertainment on TV, staff were responding in reasonable time, however they were unable to help with my question about Lounge. Jeddah airport: This is where the pain starts, the flight is stopped a few miles away from the terminal, that means it took us 25 minutes to transfer to the airport terminal. Once we reached the terminal, we were asked to go to a desk to validate our connecting flight checkin. I asked this desk about lounge they said go upstairs. I went upstairs and passed through what is called a 'transit lounge' with reclining seats 20 on each side of the passage. This was mostly full, I enquired the person incharge there said this is not the lounge and there is another lounge after the security check. I believed him and passed through the security check.Here there are two options :-1. Alfursan lounge - Initially I asked and the receptionist said it was First and  Business class only and there is no option to pay. I went and asked again after an hour this time there was a different person, I was told it is 126 Saudi Riyals per person. Basically this lounge has Air conditioning and some reclining seats and it is a large open area that is quieter than the outside area. Snacks and hot drinks are available and toilets are a little cleaner than outside. First and Business class use only or you can pay 126 Saudi Riyals per person for 4 hours.2. Terminal building: There are a number of seats here however I could not find an empty one and people were sleeping on the floor unable to find a place. I finally found a place to rest after a few hours in the 'Lounge cafe' which is at the far end of the terminal near the smoking pod. It was really tiring 8 hours as every minute there are announcements made very loud, it is not an ideal place specially if you are travelling in the night with children. Also try and avoid using the lounge behind the smoking pod, this seems to be an exclusive area for Gate 8, I noticed that people were asked to leave around 2:00 am in the morning for no reason.Toilets: Like many others said, they are smelly and horrible. The ones before the security gates are slightly better.Shopping: Decent choice of shopping available.Food: There is a reasonable number of restaurants Baskin robins, Arabian coffee house with sandwiches, a Bakery selling Crossants, sandwiches and Macroons and a convenience store selling souvenirs and necessities. Flight to Hyderabad: After the tiring long night, a further security check we queued up for the bus again which drove us for 20 minutes to board the flight. The flight had no entertainment screens, but for us it was catching up sleep time. The staff here were found to be very rude to other passengers. It is understandable that a large number of people coming there do not know how to read english and they should hire someone who can speak the language.","January 18, 2019",2,Date of travel: December 2018,,4,3,3,4,3,4,4,3
905,saudia_airlines,Exceeded my expectations,"I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.

I was offered dates, Arabic coffee and assorted juices before takeoff. Meal was way more than I could consume. Endless snacks if you want them, but I was stuffed from dinner. Fully reclining seat was amazing, I slept from Iceland to Egypt!Free wifi in First and Business Class. Large restrooms with fresh flowers for added class.Return trip was slightly less pleasant. All passengers boarded through the same door, so I felt like I was on display while hundreds of people filed past my seat.

913,saudia_airlines,A Great Flight on a new 787,"Saudia has come a long way over the years, although the breakfasts, and indeed most of the meals like most airline food is still something to avoid! Food is probably best taken in a restaurant than on a plane, although over the years there have been some notable exceptions. Saudia still has some way to go on the catering.Having said that, in economy or in business, the service is excellent and nowadays beats many more well know European and US airlines. The 787 is a very comfortable and quiet plane even if the seating plan in business is a bit weird with the groups of two in the centre and the single seats by the windows. Most people like a window or an aisle seat so it seems logical to pair the two together and not force people who wish to talk with each other to be in the middle. I guess the logic is to stop people climbing over each other if they want to leave their seat ... an interesting trade off and no doubt one that would benefit from customer research.The crew were friendly, professional, the flight confortable and on time, the luggage turned up faster than usual, the checkin was fast and east.

The Saudia terminal at Jeddah is dusgusting and the worst I have been to, Seen cleaner toilets on the streets of calcutta. This is a Saudia only terminal and although the new terminal is ready, they continue to use the old one. We paid and extra AUD$50 each to use their Alfulsen Room normally only used by firts and business class, it really was a waste of money. The furniture all old and worn out, I was sitting on couch springs. The food was ok.The toilets were cleaner but only 2 cubicales for men. On the return leg we braved the general area terminal and survived so I dont recommend paying the extra for the lounge.

I have flown business class on many airlines to and from Asia, including Qantas, ANA, American and United and I think this trip with Saudia was the best. Yes there is no alcohol and yes transiting through Jeddah is “an experience”, but otherwise the seat was fabulous, the catering was very good, bathrooms were better than I have seen on the other carriers and the staff were attentive - you just have to ask. I was a bit dubious about Saudia when I first booked this after reading the reviews, however this was quickly put to rest upon boarding. I would certainly use this airline again. Will be even better when the new Jeddah airport opens. And another comment about transiting in Jeddah is they don’t seem to care about the odd prescription sleeping pills and the like, the transit procedures were basic with a quick stop at the transit desk, a quick stop to pass hand luggage through the customs X-ray machine (presumably looking for alcohol and the likes) upstairs to security for the usual checks and then on to the Alfursan Lounge.. all in all very simple.","January 12, 2019",4,Date of travel: January 2019,"Santa Clarita, California",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They don’t bother to ask you about the menu option, when asked for blanket they replied no more available. Everything is tolerable if you consider the nightmare of Jeddah-Dhaka flight. Jeddah airport itself is a horrible place to be in transit. The board was showing flight “On time” upto the departure time even without starting boarding formalities. Suddenly at the departure time (17.00) they showed “delay”. The bus to the flight seems going to the whole of Saudi Arabia. The flight (carrier) was from ancient time. Forget the leg space and in-flight entertainment. The cabin was warm and heat was generating from the leg spaces.

Later while I was sitting in plane waiting for takeoff the counter representative came looking for me and told me they were able to manually tag my luggage all the way to Toronto and gave me new luggage tags.I was amazed at their service that while I had accepted the inconvenience of claiming and resubmitting my luggage in Paris, they had not given up and kept trying.Another thing I really liked was that toilets in their planes were larger than usual and thus more accessible.

First, the itinery of the flight didn't show that we have to stop at Medina (waste of time) Didn't know this not until we landed in Jeddah, got in the plane and found out we had to stop at Medina. We've flown with Kwait Airways before and we had to stop at Bangkok Thailand but atleast it wasn't a surprise as it was shown in our tickets. So back to Saudia. Landed at Jeddah. Couldn't believe the toilet was very poor. It was absolutely stinky. Thought it would be as good as heathrow but was very disappointed as we all know Saudi is a rich country. The toilet bowl is an old fashion one which is attached flat onto the floor and you have to aim the hole when you pee. Not very ideal if you have youbg children like my daughter who had difficulty using it.It was the south terminal as far as i can remember. The airport was quite small and it was heaving with passengers that you will find yourself just waiting for your next flight while standing. Then, flight from Manila to London, because we only had 2 hours to transfer to our connecting flight , they didnt managed to transfer our luggages. We've been told when we arrived at Heathrow that the all our luggages was left at jeddah ( what a nightmare!)So it took 3 days for us to received our pood luggages, full of damages and one padlock was broken and missing. Fortunately nothing was stolen. The cases was probably been thrown badly. And guess what, we didn't even managed to claim a compensation from the Airline for the inconvenience and damages of our luggages. Tried to do the form online and for some reason it was impossible to do it. We rang some certain numbers but they were very unprofessional and unhelpful.

937,saudia_airlines,Domestic Flight,I had a short flight experience. This was after arriving internationally.

I checked my bag and went to the departure lounge. The departure lounge for domestic flights in Jeddah is quite good and it has a lot of food options. Boarding time was good for the flight and landing was on time too. The only issue i had was seating I was moved around twice on the flight but I understand the reasons but it meant that when disembarking I had to wait for a lot of passengers as my bags were further away from my seat.

The place is also equipped with a full room, in immaculate condition, for prayers, with the right direction to turn to, independently of the plane's path, being duly indicated.All in all, did not witness any service issue, and duly noted the own style of the airline.","December 19, 2018",3,Date of travel: December 2018,"London, United Kingdom",3,2,4,2,3,3,3,1

975,saudia_airlines,An underestimated Airline,"I had travelled to Heathrow from Saudia Airlines in Nov 2018 and I selected this airline because it was on a great deal. All I had in my mindset was it would be something like a low cost airline with no poor service. Certain seats can be booked for free as well. BAH - JEDDAHThe aircraft was A320. It was clean and I was greeted with a smile. We were distributed refreshing tissue before departing. There were no personal TVs, but we were distributed headsets and guess what there was free limited wifi to access whatsapp however additional datas can be purchased. There was also inflight entertainment connected to wifi and a usb port. I had opted for special meal and I received it before everyone. It was perfect, especially the salad which was served with olive oil dressing. The lavatory was clean as well. Overall, a perfect flight with great service and food.JEDDAH TO LHRThere was a 3 hours of layover in Jeddah, the transit area is not so great but you want to have some good food try the VIP cafe, it serves amazing pasta for reasonable price. You can also access Al Fursan lounge, they may charge SAR 1300 i guess. The gates were open on time, since the runways and the terminals are far there are no bridges here. All the flights are accessed by shuttle buses only. The flight to Heathrow was 777-300 ER. We were given hot towels and drinks. They have this new concept of bistro service and it is amazing. The seats come with a pillow and a blanket. There were personalized TVs and we were also given headsets. This flight also had free wifi and a usb space. Since I had all the place for myself I slept on this smooth flight. They also have a prayer space at the back which I feel is amazing. The snacks were hummus with bread and desert. Such an amazing desert I cannot forget. There was also a Pachi choc. Now this is not a normal economy class. For breakfast, again a special meal and I was served before others. It was hot and I enjoyed those Asparagus. The crew was very friendly, I enjoyed talking with the crew while going to the lavatory. They were very active with smiling face. Finally, a smooth flight.The return experience was even better with arabic coffee served and there was food then snacks were served. The transit in Jeddah was very long and the receptionists in Al Fursan lounge were really rude. I shall not visit them again. Otherwise, everything else was amazing and I would say if your looking for Middle East carriers next time, consider Saudia and you will not regret.","December 17, 2018",5,Date of travel: November 2018,"Manama, Bahrain",4,5,0,0,5,5,5,0

First, I researched this airline and once confirmed my flight would be on the newer Airbus A330, I booked business class from Dubai to JFK with layover in Jeddah. First leg was short, service was below standard. Then for layover, the trip became an ordeal. The “lounge” was so packed there were people sitting and laying on floors. I had to sit on floor, for 4 hours ..Food was stale,very limited options, and not good. Upon boarding I was pleased that indeed the plane was as I had researched with modern lay flat seats, and diagonal seat placements (these are best so you don’t have to crawl over other passenger) and entertainment choices were very up to date with very large screen. But... after 3 hours of delay sitting in plane, they took us back to gate, where the chaos ensued. Totally disorganized, everyone crammed into one small gate area, they expected everyone to stand in that closed off space like a jail cell, for the duration of the additional 3 hour delay. Then finally we boarded again and to my dismay they had us on very old 747 plane!!! Seats were NOT lay flat (for the 14 hr flight this is not ideal), seats were smaller and in 2/2 formation. Entertainment system and choices were old from last year and very few choices. Upon speaking with attendant why we were given old plane I only got attitude and them rudely saying to just sit down. In flight experience was terrible service, NO extra food during long 14 hr flight, and the one meal we recieved was terrible low quality food. This was like traveling in economy plus, NOT BUSINESS CLASS. I emailed them after flight to formally complain and still have had no response, only an email acknowledging my email. Terrible customer service, horrible inflight experience, the switching of planes I feel cheated, layover experience & lounge was THE WORST!

No good seating area i was sat on the floor with my young children for ages is this what they call respect to women! They dont no how to. Madina airport was the best very respectful and alot of respect towards women. Heads up to madina. The women workers in the niqaabs were of disgusting manner in jeddah airport very rude. I would love to go again but hate to go to jeddah airport. U will be very lucky if you recieve the opposite of what i stated. As that is probably once in a life time it happens.

1021,saudia_airlines,Saudias inflight Duty Free scam,So turns out the entire inflight Duty Free is a total scam on Saudia airlines. I wouldnt have noticed until it was pointed out to me by a fellow passenger who refered to a friend of his Saudia cabin crew. After 4 flights on Saudia none had actual duty free sales. On the first flight i was told by the purser they forgot to load the duty free cart. On the 2nd flight i was told by the purser hes a new one and did not know how to use the point of sale machine therefore no sales unless you pay cash no change available and no purchase receipt either.on the 3rd flight i was told they have duty free but the credit card mashine is broken o no sales unless cash only no change and no purchase receipts either. On the last flight i was told there is duty free the machine is working but the moment you try to pay with a credit card NO ITEMS ARE AVAILABLE. If you pay cash with no change if u happen to have bigger notes and no purchase receipts then everything is available. Only the purser handels the sales on each flight and he always asks you how are u paying cash or credit card. On my puzzlment the fellow saudi passenger told me its a Saudi airlines mafia.they never sell anything for credit card payment because they have no incentive todo so.theyd sell all for cash.pickpocket the cash divide it between themselves.no sell receipts issued and then claim it as a loss for the airline. A serious question to Saudia what kind of criminals do you employ.how do you think the above situation reflect on overal customer service experiense?..i even cought the purser on the last flight outright lying...said let me check if items are available...instead he went to the back of the plane got himself a coffee and sat down.when he sow me comming he jumped and tried to run forward..as i confronted him about the availability he plain said oh its not available...i asked can you tell me which items i asked for he could not...you didnt checked since i right followed you sir i said he plain lied he did. Saudia=very dishonest cheating n lying cabin crews....i should know its 4 different flights with 4 different cabin crews pursers all same criminals.Will you fly Saudia again?...i dont think so...You really should discontinue the fraud inflight duty free all together...instead of wasting my time and other passengers time writing honest negative reviews about your national...really a national airline???

I had delay 2 times of my 4 flights. It was OK for me, cause i have plenty of time. But you might consider this.The lay over in Jeddah was really bad. First of all, the security check was aweful. It was only 1 scanner for each gender. Officer for body search was 1 for female. Yes, they do security check separately. It caused jam on the security check, i won't surprised some passager would lost their connection due to this security check hassle. The transit area was even more horrible. It was really small, too many people cramped together in the room. The chair was limited, people were laying on the cold hard granite floor just like refugee. The toilet are worn out and dirty.

From Jeddah to Paris we had the same plane. Only us in first class. The plane departed two hours late because they spilled all the fuel. The crew and the food was very good I have to say. Once in Paris we lost our connection to Málaga, went to Saudia office, two rude woman in the counter, I explained our problem and their answer was; it’s not Saudias policy to help us and we have to buy new tickets. Saudia and Air France are in the same group, Sky Team and they wouldn’t do anything about it. Unreal. Stocked in Paris with my 8 year old daughter...I managed to buy another ticket arriving Málaga 10 hours late. Things to remember:No fingers for the embarks.

1027,saudia_airlines,A very good all round experience and one of the most generous allowances anywhere,"Saudia Airlines is clearly a mixed bag, you read through the reviews and what you see is hit or miss. I booked for a group of nine, over six months in advance. The website was straightforward and i found the online element as good as any other airline. My flights ended up being changed, by Saudia twice. Both times i had to ring to re-check all my details and my seats had to be confirmed three times on three occasions. This was unnecessary faff and why i haven't awarded five stars, even though the staff were courteous and helpful to get things resolved.I don't often review airlines, but i feel Saudia gets plenty of flack so it's important to provide a positive experience when this is the overall outcome. I travelled to three destinations, Jeddah, Dubai and back to London Heathrow as part of a group of nine. In all honesty i was expecting a third rate service, so i had mentally prepped myself for a stoic experience, instead I have to say, Saudia Airlines really came through for me. Their overall service and product was excellent. I was genuinely surprised and pleased and feel this must be expressed.For starters Saudia offer one of the most generous baggage allowances per person that i have ever seen, in economy you can travel with 2 x 23kg suitcases, plus hold luggage separate, plus 5kg free Zamzam water if returning from Saudia Arabia, seriously which airline can beat this. You then have ample leg room, also in economy, which beats most airlines hands down. This is a huge benefit to all passengers and worth using just for this. I thought the food was as good as Emirates - one of the best airlines and facilities on board greatly improved with excellent screens and on demand options.Where Saudia Airlines is a little weak is their overall customer service. I personally had no issues, but noted a few scrapes with others. Nothing serious, but the overall service doesn't quite hit standards from other Airlines. What is not Saudia Airlines fault is the generally poor facilities at places like Jeddah Airport and Riyadh. Unfortunately for them, they are seen as the front-line for inadequate facilities at these airports so get panned when things go wrong, even though it is not directly them at fault. My overall experience with Saudia Airlines has been very good, and i benefited from an excellent value for money price, with very generous baggage and seating allowances. They have some way to go to improve their overall experience, but i have to say i have been very impressed and will certainly use them again.","November 9, 2018",4,Date of travel: October 2018,"Leicester, United Kingdom",5,3,4,4,5,5,5,3

I am a 7-months pregnant woman and while on a stop-over in Jeddah I was verbally abused and humiliated by Saudia staff. In addition, due to their incompetence, I had to buy a new ticket for an additional 1K USD.On a stopover from Jeddah, the gate for my connecting flight (business class ticket) closed before the 20 minutes deadline (the gate agent himself admitted to me that the flight had closed early) so I missed my connection. When I asked to be placed on the next flight I was severely mistreated: -Saudia staff members were not able to provide me with information on the next flight or rebook me. -Note that I couldn't rebook myself on another airline as I did not possess a visa to leave that terminal (which is only Saudia). -Instead staff (a group of 5-6 men) laughed at me on numerous occasions, while pointing while I was crying. I was repeatedly told that the only solution was to sleep on the floor and wait for the next morning's flight (they never gave me an answer on why they couldn't rebook me now, but could magically do so for the next day).-Several different staff members claimed to be the ""manager"" and sent me around in circles around the airport (I crossed security over 5 times) only to be sent back to the original ""manger"". This whole process took ~4 hours. -The only solution to this ordeal and to get out of Jeddah was for my husband to spend another 1K to buy a new ticket (the Saudia staff in Jeddah were not even able to arrange for me to purchase a new ticket at the airport). I was finally able to get a ""manager"" to print my boarding pass, as I was also refused this service by several others.-Upon arriving in the UAE, my luggage was lost for several days. This was a terrible experience, one that I would never expect from a Skyteam Alliance partner. Do yourself a favour and NEVER use Saudia.P.S.

When we asked the staff to please see if there is any spare, she came back within 10 min with a chicken meal. She told us that this is for us, but it actually is for the staff. I was shocked. I told her to keep her staff meal and again no food.This was our 5th wedding anniversary and we wanted to be special.

During those 11 years I was never upgraded to a higher class, while on another loyalty program I was immediately upgraded the moment I joined.

May Allah give them hidaya and passengers sabr (patience) .On board Staff - -The crew member are so unfriendly. Manageable with non Arabs but when you have Arab crew My god.. I wonder from where they get that attitude. My recent experience was when we asked for a blanket he said he didn't have started arguing with us. Later he brings his supervisor and that person also a bighead he will argue a lot. When it came time to serve food the crew member was so impolite that he said he had no vegetarian food. Just b'coz he had to go pantry and bring another one.. this shows his laziness and his commitment toward his work. Later one of her colleague (who is non arab) intervene in our conversation & asked about the issue I said I don't want to have chicken instead I need veg to which she said that she has plenty of veg food and returned back with veg dish for me n family. I was very upset with this guy behavior. Look, it's not the matter of food, its about the mental status of the person who behaved weirdly it shows how lazy these guys are... and how they deal with guests. Very bad experience. And this is not the first time every time you travel with SV they always lack with blankets, cushions. They very coolly declare they don't have I wonder what they do the with the check list before take off.

Inflight service was okay, just average. The worst part that made me swear never to fly this airline again was on the second leg when departing from Jeddah. Since we were traveling in a family group of 15 people with children and senior citizens, l was concerned about our seating. I wanted our seats to be adjacent to each other so that l will be able to take care of their needs. Therefore l did an online checkin for everyone in the group to secure our seats but were unable to print the boarding pass since we were staying at a hotel and communication with the unfriendly Arab speaking front office was also a problem, so there was no way to request printing . I did screenshot the seat numbers to prove that l had booked the seats. At the airport, we were instructed to queue at the North America line, even though l had already notified the staff that our destination was Kuala Lumpur. The staff insisted that we were in the right line. When l reached the check in counter after a long, slow queue, true enough, we were denied bag drop and were instructed to queue in the Asian line. We obliged patiently though most of us was already furious. When our turn came at the Asian line, l requested to just bag drop and print our boarding pass. To my dismay, the staff simply assigned us to separated seats at his own whim. When l objected and claimed that l had already checked in and booked the seats, he just ignored me and gave the most annoying expression while continuing to play, l suppose games in his handphone. Up to the point that l thought he probably couldn't understand English or just deaf.

After a lot of calls and visits to Saudi Airline offices in Pakistan, one person agreed to help us by giving us a changed flight from Jeddah to London and on-wards to YYZ via Air Canada.According to our ticket we reached to Jeddah from Islamabad. Our next flight from Jeddah to London got delayed and when we reached to London, the next flight to Canada via Air Canada was closed. The Air Canada staff was so surprised that we didn't have any boarding passes for our next flight. Initially they refused to entertain us but eventually after a lot of requests they agreed to give us seats in the next flight. We had to wait another 4 hours for the next flight. No one from Saudi Airline was there to help us or apologized. I was travelling with my family and we had a 2 year old with us. It was so difficult to wait further 4 hours at airport.The flight from Isb - Jeddah - YYZ normally takes 17-18 hours. Due to this all fiasco, it took us close to 30 hours.

It would then be sent directly to us to our hotel, to arrive later in the afternoon.After spending a full 30 minutes trying two numbers given to us on the PIR form without answering, we have just had a message from our last hotel to say you are too busy delivering baggage and ours should arrive at our hotel tomorrow, Fri 3 Aug.As ALL of our baggage is missing, This means that we have been without a change of clothes, no toiletries, no medication and no holiday personal effects, including camera and charging ports for a full week!!!Chennai desk gave us 6000inr for essentials after we complained that we were left with nothing but the clothes we were wearing and light hand luggage.

The flight from KL was packed, not a big plane, full of pilgrams making ummrah to Mecca. I mention because it's worth noting that this sector should be avoided if in need of support and in need of extra space. I think staff at Jeddah airport cannot cope with the numbers.I need assistance and all the passengers who needed support were left on the tarmac for over an hour awaiting transport to the terminal, which is a very long way. Once there no assistance was provided and when questioned the staff were useless telling us we'd miss our connection. I struggled to walk and demanded to make my next flight.

1139,saudia_airlines,It's quirky for a Westerner traveling.,"The flight was really reasonable, cost-wise. For such a long flight, they should hand out bottles of water -- you can buy water at the airports, but they do a security search (in Egypt and Saudi) just before you board, and they take the water, that you just bought in the airport, away! Egypt Air works the same way, btw.The prayer before you take off was fine, even if they say that your final destination may be elsewhere.Seating: On the long flights, they take out several center rows for a prayer space. For some reason, I thought it would be quiet there, thinking about western prayer spaces. But it's not, and it's constant. That's fine. That's their tradition. But if you want to sleep, choose a seat as far from the prayer room as you can.Also be prepared to move a bit to accommodate women who prefer women seatmates.On the flight over, there was a five hour layover in Jeddah which was somewhat uncomfortable. The gate for the flight to Cairo changed quite a bit, but my airline app kept up. Women go through a different security line than men in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The women physically pat you down but are very respectful of your person. Would I fly with them again?

You have to redo the baggage check-in during the stop-over and if your first flight is delayed, you add further stress to the overall flight experience. Furthermore, at the check-in, they often don't inform you that you have to pick-up your baggage if you land in a different Saudi airport than your final destination.","September 5, 2018",3,Date of travel: August 2018,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",3,3,3,3,3,2,3,1

The people around me did not have the seat belts on during take off or landing, and kids continued to run the aisles during both as well. The rules are in place to protect us in case something should happen. If something happens on one of these flights, many people are likely to get injured due to the lack of security measures enforced. Again, the people working the flight going and coming were indeed lovely, but they couldn't control the rowdy crowd of guests at all.

The aircraft was average. You can only use their earphones - cheap ones, useless. My screen didn't work properly so no games. Food average and they ran out of some choices early on.

This resulted in a conflict with our Booked domestic/local flight with another airline so this incurred additional expense to rebook.2.

What shocked us was that women were hustled to the female section and the section is surrounded by wall. It gives the feeling that you do not quite know if you are going to come out alive. Not to mention the cramped waiting hall with very limited seats. If you are hungry, you can only have baskin robbins. Oh, and the screen is also quite a problem. 15min before boarding, it said : Go to Gate. But without gate number! We were not able to find a personnel and luckily we spotted a cleaner and he was able to tell us that we have to listen to the announcement (with poor quality audio system). With fellow travellers from the previous flight who are going to KL as well, we decided to guard a boaring gate per group. The group who is at the correct gate informs the others.It's not finished! We got on to a shuttle bus thinking that we will finally be onboard but the bus turned around the airport for at least 30min seemingly looking for the correct aircraft. After 2 aircrafts parking, we finally found it! Same attitude from stewards/stewardess, same annoying shouts from children, same in flight experiences from the 1st flight...........And of course, same experience for the return flight ><","August 2, 2018",1,Date of travel: July 2018,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The flight attendants in business section were highly attentive and professional. The food options were plentiful and the food was tasty. The full flat seat was well padded making for a comfortable sleep.

1181,saudia_airlines,Terrible Experience - Delayed Baggage - Nightmare,"I am trying to get any care or attention regarding my case that has led to a terrible experience with Saudi Airlines.My wedding was scheduled to be hosted in Maldives on the 6th of July 2018. My family, relatives, friends and myself had booked all 24 tickets through Saudi Airlines.We departed from Dubai on the 4th of July to Riyadh and after a long 9 hours stay we were on our way to Male.It came to our surprise once we reached Male international Airport that our 15 bags did not arrive and were left behind in Riyadh International Airport. They could not be sent back immediately as the next flight to Male was on the 8th of July, which was not a solution as the invited guests had their return flight on the 8th and collected their bags when they arrived back to Dubai Airport.My wife and my own personal back only arrived to us 6 days later as we stayed longer in Male. I do not understand how bad can this be!This was the biggest shock of our life and our dreams were shattered of having a wedding in Maldives as all our suits and clothes were not with us.Not just the groom and the bride but the whole family were in total shock and despair. I cant express enough on how it damaged us emotionally and financially. We had to pay for the wedding as it couldn't be cancelled and all our efforts, hard-work and time in getting the best outfit for the wedding was gone to waste.My friends and family had important health related medicines that caused them stress and pain as we could not buy the same medicines from Maldives hospitals. It was a nightmare.You do understand that wedding is the most special day in an individuals life and finding out a few ours before your wedding that all your bags and clothes are left behind is just too disappointing and disheartening.Please note that i am sending this review on behalf of my friends and family as their tickets were booked and paid by me and i am the one who had to go through all the loss financially.I am hoping that Saudi Airlines will solve this matter as this has caused an ample amount of stress and misery. I will always remember on how my wedding was cancelled and how i was financially broken by that loss.","July 30, 2018",1,Date of travel: July 2018,,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,1

Infact this is our first fly with SAUDIA, even though after reading very bad rating on skytrax and tripadvisor, i just would like to experience myself. In term of check in/boarding from origin of departure all the staff look very professional and provide the best service. During flight to Jeddah (for transit), the response time of the air steward/stewardess seem pretty slow and busy chatting among themselves. At Jeddah airport we do not face any challenge or bad experience going thru security since I'm SkyTeam partner. We just feel disappointing with Alfursan Lounge in term of cleanliness and poor up keep of the lounge. The airport basically pretty crowded passenger seating and sleeping on the floor at their respective gate. Regardless if you are business/economy class, you have to take the same bus toward your next flight plane. On our final flight to our destination, food wise i would said great, same as first flight the flight attendance services too busy chatting among them self almost all the times which cause a very poor response.

1200,saudia_airlines,The fastest flight but not necessarily the best ,"To be fair, Saudia for short flights it’s ok. I took it for the first time for a flight to the US, and the service was not up to my expectations. The flight from RUH had a long stopover in Jeddah.We had a weird experience when the plane almost landed = touched land in Jeddah, and then briskly took off again. No explication from the pilot for many long minutes, than a stewardess announced that « due to high traffic (in the sky) we had to delay our landing. » Many passengers laughed, it looked more likely that the high traffic was on the ground and that maybe the pilot tried landing in a lane that was already used by another airplane?We will never know.The stopover in Jeddah is annoying, you have to pick up all your luggage first and check in again.The second leg of the flight was uneventful.I found very awkward that the first meal we were served was breakfast. Of course there is no alcohol served on Saudia flights, which is ok, but also all other soft drinks/juices were extremely scarce. Coffee and tea was abundant.The other meal was just an hour before landing, which was when most people kind of wake up, and was fish with curry rice or chicken with vegetables. At that point I would have appreciated something more like breakfast, but by then I was so hungry that I could have eaten anything. And btw no juices or soda’s just coffee and tea.In between there was nothing (this is a 16 hours flight): or better I was told there were hot sandwiches served but I was asleep and (when I asked for food in the middle of the flight) they were finished. My neighbors also didn’t get any apparently.An hostess was so kind to share with me her own personal cookies. There were some extra muffins left over which I didn’t fancy.Another thing that I found appealing was the condition of the toilets. I tried them all (main cabin) and they were all in a terrible state. I pointed out at each time to a crew member that there was no paper whatsoever.All in all, take this flight if you have to but be prepared with your own food and tissues.","July 18, 2018",3,Date of travel: July 2018,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4,3,0,0,4,4,4,0

In airport, flight delayed and no one there told what the status is or where to go, because on the screen, it says ""Flight gate closed"" and still they wont inform what the gate number is. If screen is wrong, I would at least like someone in their customer support team to respond. Their team does not respond or look at us in eye even if we speak. They just stare at computer and stay quite.That was insulting.Food wasn't good at all.And in Jeddah, they did allow us in waiting lounge and they person there mixed veg with non veg as I am a vegetarian.

So we took a cab back to the airport and the person at the baggage window said it arrived so she escorted us to to the claim area. When we get there we are told this is not true and they do not know where our luggage is. So Tuesday we call all day and finally they answer to say the baggage is here and will be sent to our hotel. The bag never arrived. On Wednesday our tour guide called for us and they said the bag just arrived one hour ago and we will get it at our hotel by the end of the day. I called again at 5pm before the office was to close and they promised the bag would arrive. It is now Thursday morning and today we leave for Tanzania. Ugh.....

1237,saudia_airlines,Unethical business practices and pathetic customer service,"(1) They decided to cancel my flight about 3 weeks before the departure. They asked me to pick another day instead. Since it was December, they had very limited availability. I repeatedly told them that because of this flight change, I would miss my niece's marriage which was the sole reason why I was traveling. Secondly, I had connecting flights that I had re-book. I demanded compensation for this. They didn't pay me a penny even though it was clearly their mistake. If the customers are asked to pay the change fee and fines if they change itinerary, the airline should also be fined. But sadly it is a one way agreement. Because of them, I missed my niece's marriage. I also ended up paying for re-booking my onward journey out of my pocket.(2) Unbelievably pathetic customer service in the plane. My wife had to fight with the air-hostesses to get milk for my 2 year old. They didn't have vegetarian food option. No, Asian vegetarian food is not truly vegetarian. It contains fish and eggs. Hindu vegetarian is also not truly vegetarian as it shockingly contained eggs. My wife and I remained hungry for the most of the 24 hours long flight. But the most shocking issue was that they didn't even have anything for kids. We asked for fruits and milk and they refused to give them. It was only after my wife's shouting at a few air-hostesses that they were magically able to bring fruits.(3) In the return journey, they gave us seats at different places. My wife and kids were at one corner of the plane and I was at another. The reason they gave us was that we came late to the boarding. Hey, we have already paid for the flights. We are surely flying. Can't you guys make sure that the whole family sits together.(4) They refused to give my kid the bassinet seat.The only positive was that the flight ticket price was reasonable particularly considering that it was peak season.

Of course I didn't accept this nor the other passengers with me, so I insisted that they book me a flight on any other airline leaving ASAP, so they sent another clerk with us to the sales office and all they kept saying was "" sorry there are no flights"" so I went online and showed them all the available flights and asked them "" how can you say there are no flights?"" They insisted that there are no flights, so I kind of lost hope and was about to go back home, but decided to go back to the office where they gave us the bad news and then asked one clerk to double check what he can do, so to my luck he says that someone cancelled his seat for an unknown reason and gave me his seat.Now I know that some airlines overbook, but overbooking more than 50 passengers during high season ""eid holidays "" is a joke I would say.All in all I cannot depend on Saudia anymore after I used to use it as my first choice.","June 18, 2018",1,Date of travel: June 2018,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",3,2,0,0,3,1,2,0

Our return flight was also delayed and they kept changing our stopover and final destination airports!! I spent at least an hour each day of the holiday at 2am calling their offices because of time differences on hold and they offered no solutions to help us reach home in a safe normal way together. Decisions for changes to our tickets and route were made automatically without notification or confirmation from us and my friend even had her return ticket deleted from their system without her knowledge the day before flying. Staff at every point (the flight counters in different countries, offices and on the phone) are unhelpful and “powerless” to assist telling us any changes and charges come out of their direct salary, the airline cannot compensate anything, even with any issues caused by their own team. They have no complaints department. Supervisors are rude, aggressive and ultimately refuse to assist you. The worst airline experience of my life, it ruined the holiday and a friendship due to the stress, and left me out of pocket for a lot of incurred expenses. Also Jeddah airport is not very nice - don’t let them put you there for a 10hour stopover.

1260,saudia_airlines,Strange airline,"I fly this airline regularly for business to Saudi. On Business Class flights Frankfurt-Riyadh (ca 6 hour flight) there was no internet and no screen at the seat (poor). In an econ flight Riyadh-Jeddah or Jeddah-Medina (0.55h-1.45h) they have internet and inflight entertainment. They used to have a prayer niche in the back, not any more. Since Saudia partnered with SkyTeam all screens and information are French, while Saudis are in fact more English speaking if any foreign language at all. It feels very awkward to see everything in French. It only happens on Saudi airlines that children can stand on the seat during take off and landing in business class and no body cares. Stewards find it normal that kids scream and cry throughout the entire flight or run along the corridors unattended. Seats are at times torn with coffee staines. When calling the hotline to change reservations or buy an upgrade, all lines are suddenly ""busy"" during prayer times, one small prompt error and you need to call again and wait for ever. Due to Saudisation only Saudis work there. Though service attitude has changed a little to the better but generally still unable to make decisions or understand fully how fare rules work and rather ask another manager to deal with it. The default answer is always ""No"". English is generally poor. At times I wish they would just outsource their hotline to India like some other airlines. It could not get much worse than Saudi Airline reservation line. It is somewhat a punishment to be forced to deal with Saudi Airline reservations line and I advise to have a travel agent instead. As a ""religious"" country, one would have thought that the ladies working as stewardesses are covered up - they are not. It is a strange unconsistent corporate culture which I try to understand. It is neither here nor there. Given the direct flights and extra luggage and pricing offered I opt for SV over BA, LH or Emirates. But only on trips to KSA. Never ever use SV for CONNECTING flights (in RUH and JED). It is a true pain. You will have to take your bags out yourself, transfer them yourself and take a bus to the next terminal yourself in smelly and hot busses with half of the world on the bus that still carry luggage in linen tied to the head. Immigration lines in JED are just a torture, sometimes you may be lucky to be waived through in 20 minutes but it is totally normal to expect a few hours watching Saudi immigration officials chatting online and sipping at coffee or just leaving their booth in a temper.","May 28, 2018",2,Date of travel: May 2018,"Frankfurt, Germany",2,1,3,3,3,1,4,1

A 3 hour layover in Jeddah standing the whole time, multiple security checks while employees are allowed to smoke in your face. We were bused to a lot again and herded to a plane. The flight arrived 2 hours late and I'm still missing luggage. There is no concern on their part. You are treated as if they have done you a favor. I was provided a number to contact them about my luggage, which is just a voicemail. No one has returned my calls.

The Conditions of Carriage (which form part of the agreement between the airline and the customer) specify that Saudia will use its Best Efforts to expedite travel. They did nothing. Without consulting/advising me, they cancelled my booking and booked me on a flight sequence that resulted in a 36 hour delay when there were MANY flight options that would have resulted in minimal delay. Saudia claims 'force majeure' due to weather, but they completely disregarded their agreed upon contractual obligations towards their passengers. Saudia ground staff were non-existent. No accountability or authority provided to subcontract staff to engage with Saudia customers. They did the same to other passengers, including one who was traveling with 80+ year old parents. No accommodation made for them. The one Saudia representative I found in Riyadh agreed that Saudia should have placed their customers on a different carrier out of Amman, but said that he had no authority to place customers on an earlier flight because the flight originated in Amman.

Staff are always friendly and professional, though a bit subdued (certainly not in a bad way). Security in markets that might require it - is much tighter than competitors. Their fares are traditionally great especially on longer haul flights - would definitely suggest giving them a try.","April 29, 2018",5,Date of travel: April 2018,"Atlanta, Georgia",5,4,5,5,4,3,5,5
1322,saudia_airlines,Satisfactory Flight.,We flew from Johannesburg to Jeddah on board Saudi Airlines and we had a connecting flight 3 hours later from Jeddah to Madinah.The flight was fairly satisfactory. Leg room was decent and seats were comfortable. Our connecting flight was a bit of a disaster as we missed our flight due to long ques that that just didn't move.

1323,saudia_airlines,Good flight with worst connecting airport (Jeddah),"We travelled from Toronto to Delhi in Saudia Airlines. Flight itself was a good experience with ontime takeoff and landing ( no delays). Air hostesses were very nice and energetic, provided very good service to all the passengers. Food was quite reasonable. It became problematic after landing at Jeddah. Security people were all rude and doesn't know what they were doing. Washrooms were all dirty, leaking water from the urinals. Literally I saw some guys even smoking in the washrooms. People lying on the floor, because there were not enough chairs for everyone. Couldn't find even drinking water fountain.Even to make it more worse, flight experience from Jeddah to delhi became more worse, ( not due to flight itself), but people who were boarded from Jeddah, made the flight filthy. During boarding they were pushing each other like animals, as if they never lined up in a que in their lifetime. During whole 5 hour flight, they were going in the washrooms and washing their feets on the floor and throwing tissues on the floor making mess. I feel sorry for the air hostesses , despite their so many warnings to them, they kept doing it.In a nutshell, for future travel, we decided not to travel along that route (Jeddah).

1324,saudia_airlines,Horrible Airline with no service and communication,"Flown from Karachi to Jeddah and then Jeddah to Toronto. Never ever that I faced this kind of bad service in last 30 years of me traveling. The flight timing they provide are incorrectThe departure time is incorrect as the flight never arrives from a previous destination on time. The international terminal for flight connection at Jeddah can not called a terminal but a jail cell where over crowded people are sitting on floor everywhere waiting for flight. This is in addition for the 2 hours you will wait in the plane with no announcement from the airline (forget about the apology)My flight was no different as check the arrival pattern for Saudia and you can soon see that 9:45am arrival is never before 10:45 am because they are late departing Jeddah. In addition you will be lucky to get your luggage you checked in as they consider it as a privilege. I have not received mine after 5 days since I arrived back. In addition, there is no reimbursement of any kind from any one as you are considered to be home so why would you need your luggage anyway. To top it off after writing emails, calling the numbers numerous time and 2 further flights arrival as of April 26, 2018 there is no sign of my luggage or any apology from the airline. Finally for all the smart travelers make sure that you read your coverage and insurance policy as that doesn’t cover anything either as you are not at destination but “Home” unfortunately. RBC Avion cardExtra insurance ($140)Nothing covers not even a single cent. Finally this wasn’t a luck of the draw but mismanagement on airline part as my name was being called at the airport to contact the airline. Finally there is no customer service desk or the airline phone number toll free. You will have to call 966 920003777 and you guessed it right it’s Saudia number and you will have to pay and good luck getting through and if you ever will good luck finding anyone speaking a word of English.The email for customer relations is a scam as well as you won’t get a response backBuyers beware.

Women must wear long pants as well as a top with long sleeves... and shoes which cover the feet [i.e. No sandals].Men must also wear long pants and shirts cannot be of the ""muscle type""!.In addition, I had to prove when- and how- I would travel after arriving in Paris... and, if I was staying in Paris I would have to show the reservation for a hotel. {There was a young woman from China (who was in line behind us)--- who was going to Turkey-- BUT did not have a reservation at a hotel in Istanbul! She was denied the flight--- after having flown on 2 airlines prior to arriving in Kuala Lumpur!!}.I did have to show them my plane reservation on WestJet on 22 June-- when we fly into Toronto... and also my 8+ week car rental reservation!!I young Saudi guy came to the airport with shorts... and he had to hustle and buy a pair of long pants!!The first plane from Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah was a Boeing 787-- called “the Dreamliner”... and it was a pleasure. The seats were big and very comfortable! But “service” was an issue--- it took almost 1 hour 10 minutes to get a “head set” so we could watch and hear (an approved) movie.Also, for the first time in my memory, someone took part of my “stowed (in the overhead bins) luggage”. The second plane was a Boeing 777--- similar to the newer 787--- lots of “leg room” and the seats are bigger than usual. Unfortunately, the service was not much better. I suspect that as the flight has both men and women providing cabin service... and, as most Saudi men have limited experience working with women there is a distinct lack of collaboration/cooperation among the flight cabin crew!!","April 25, 2018",2,Date of travel: April 2018,"Penang Island, Malaysia",5,1,5,3,5,3,4,1

1351,saudia_airlines,Extreme delays,"I am writing this review almost 2 weeks after returning home from a holiday in Egypt. Down with a flu.For reasons of relative costs, I had asked my travel agents to book me return from Kuala Lumpur to Cairo on Saudia. Both up and return involved connecting flights from Jeddah to Cairo and vice versa. I have no complaints about my flight from KL to Jeddah on the 24 March. On time and service was as expected, good. However the connecting flight to Cairo, SV 0305, was a total mess! The scheduled transit was almost 4 hours. Passengers were boarded almost an hour before take off time. Then the problems started. Plane moved on time from its bay, and after a wait of about 20 minutes or so, returned to its parking. All that the Captain announced was “instructed “to return to bay because of some technical issue! No further announcements for the next one hour! Then told it will probably take off after approximately another hour or so. Nothing else. Nothing definite. It’s then that many, and I mean many, of the local passengers started harassing the cabin crew who seemed clueless and helpless too! To me this noisy and unhealthy situation could have been avoided IF the Captain had been proactive and forthcoming. Nothing like timely and appropriate communication to soothe highly tired passengers and frayed tempers. Sadly I must say that it was a failing not to be admired!Well to shorten it, I arrived in Cairo airport 3+ hours late, about 12+ after midnight and my poor tour manger and driver too had to suffer. By the time I arrived in LeMeridien Cairo, ( that is another story!)checked in and went to bed, it was almost 24 hours from door to door! My return Saudia flight from Cairo on 31April, too was delayed about 3 hours, but this time, thankfully , passengers were notified while at the terminal itself. Originally scheduled to depart at 12.20 noon , first announced delay to 13.05 , but finally left at almost 1500!! Connecting passengers to Kuala Lumpur, an almost 9 hours flight, were lucky not to have missed their flights scheduled for 2020 pm. Oh boy wasn’t it tiring and stressful. This flight was fully booked with passengers returning after performing their UMRAH. In short and on hindsight, I can’t help wondering if my decision to fly Saudia was a wise one, especially considering my age. I only hope that this avoidable issue is just confined to this sector and not widely prevalent. ","April 13, 2018",2,Date of travel: March 2018,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1360,saudia_airlines,Experience with Saudia Airlines and Jeddah Airport,"On last month I had a round trip between Johannesburg - Cochin. Could see that Saudia airlines provides comparatively low price than other Airlines at that time.Previoulsly I used to travel in Emirates airlines only.So naturally I am comparing my experience with Saudia Airlines with my previous travel in Emirates. The first good thing about Saudia Airlines that it provides tickets on low price.My travel was like below,Johannesburg - Jeddah - CochinCochin - Jeddah - JohannesburgAfter booking the tickets, I was going through some of the reviews. I was really shocked that when I hear that Jeddah is the one of the worst Airport in the world as per some of the travel sites and I have around 8 hours connection time in Jeddah.But things were not bad as expectedI was started my first trip with Saudia Airlines from Johannesburg Airport. The check in and boarding process were smooth at Airport.Could see that some of the Cabin crews were not that professional (For eg, in emirates cabin crew were greeting all the passengers while boarding the flight. But in Saudia I can see that they were just standing near on the door. When I greet them, thy thought I was asking something to them :) ).Inside the flight, I feel there is good leg space between seats and seats were not that great but good. For Entertainment, the TVs were not working initially and they took near to 1 - 1.5 hours to fix it.Instead of head phones, Saudia will provide earphones.Saudia censored some scenes and dialogues in the movieAbout food and Beverages:Saudia doesn’t serve Alcohol in the flight. Only Juices/Soft drinks/Tea/coffee will be serve in the flight. The food served was good but not that greatThe journey was Johannesburg to Jeddah was smooth, it landed on time. The flight will land very far from the terminal. Once we came out from flight, busses will be there which will take us to terminal. It took around 20 min from flight to terminal.All Saudia airlines flights are landed in South Terminal. Once we reached South Terminal, there is queue for transist passengers, they will check our boarding pass and provide one transits card.Once you collected transit card, walk through staircase which will lead to transfer lounge. If you are lucky, you will get seat there for rest. Transfer lounge is small and most of the its rush too.If your connection time is short (Even 3 hours), they will ask to go to terminal. I read many reviews that transit in Jeddah airport was hectic for long connection time. But I would say that if you get a seat in transfer lounge, then you can relax. Even Transfer lounge is small, its clean and well maintained.Below are the facilities which I saw in the transfer lounge,Seats for take rest (some seats we can use for sleeping)ACTelevisionFlight schedule monitorsComputer systemsWifiFood & Beverages (It will be available only if your connection time is more than 6 hours. Doesn’t have much varieties for the food but whatever we got was good)Toilet (Only for Gents; For ladies, toilets are available on departure terminal only)Departure terminal is just 2 min walkable distance from transfer lounge. So it is advisable to stay till boarding starts.Jeddah south departure terminal is too small and crowded. If you are lucky, then you will get seat there. Not much options for Shopping there. I saw only 2-3 shops for shopping and didn’t see much items there.Saw 2-3 restaurants there.Bathrooms in the departure terminal is always wet. I saw that they frequently cleaning the bathrooms with hose.My connection flight was scheduled for 3:15 AM, but till 2:50 AM, the boarding gate is not displayed. Feel that helpdesk was not helpful since they didn’t give attention to our questions.As I mentioned, it again took 20 mins in bus to reach near flight. flight was delayed for 30 mins. Both the time when I board flight from Jeddah it was delayed 30 - 45 mins.Inside flight it was the same standard as mentioned above, but in Jeddah - Cochin flights don’t have any Television.Only early morning near to 5:00 AM, we got rice and chicken curry in the flight. Got surprised, since on other Airlines I haven’t got heavy meal on early morning.The travel was smooth to Cochin. Experience On return travel from Cochin - Johannesburg also same as above. In Cochin- Jeddah flight, they haven’t provided blankets. When I asked, they replied they doesn’t have. Shocked that why an Airline is not providing blankets to passengers on journey.The experience with Saudia Airlines and Jeddah airport is not that bad as I expected from previous reviews.Bipin Peter","April 11, 2018",3,Date of travel: March 2018,"Johannesburg, South Africa",3,2,3,3,4,3,3,3

1364,saudia_airlines,Mixed feelings ,"Haven’t travelled on Saudia on an international flight for some time... so since they now have newer aircraft I thought I would try it. Leaving from Jeddah has its downside which I will not talk about ... we boarded on time however the flight was 30min late departing.... the aircraft was a B787-9 the seats on Business class are very reasonable and with plenty of storage area, a nice sized monitor.. and the seat can be converted to flat bed. The aircraft was clean. The flight attendants were helpful in general. The flight was just over 5 hours. The entertainment was good. We were serve one meal.. breakfast which was average or even below average.. the hot meal was cold and of a small portion... tea and coffee were served very late... and until landing nothing else was served. The amenities were Ok In general this was not a bad experience.. however since I’m used to use Turkish Airlines from Madina for my traveling I would not in the future use this root through JED on Saudia.... comparing the value for the money, Turkish airlines is definitely better.","April 9, 2018",3,Date of travel: March 2018,"Medina, Saudi Arabia",5,3,0,0,5,3,3,0

1366,saudia_airlines,Stranded! Desperate for a solution to get home on 12 April 2018!!,"My family and I spent 6 yrs looking forward to a dream return to the Maldives, where we currently find ourselves. Paradise indeed, but the experience has been spoiled by the revelation that our airline Saudia (fka Saudi Airlines) has cancelled our return flights leaving us effectively stranded. The cancellation is due to a rescheduled leg which in their opinion means we will miss our connection in Jeddah back to London (despite a gap of 80 mins - apparently the minimum is 90!).The only option they have offered as a solution is a “partial refund” (but they have still not confirmed the amount) leaving us to then source our own flights home. Where is our trusty travel agent in this mess you may ask? Well, we booked through Expedia and they are proving about as helpful as a chocolate teapot. Expedia helpfully point to the fact they sent 2 emails to me 3 weeks ago advising of a problem with the return flight, emails which went to my spam folder and which therefore went unnoticed. They profess to have “tried calling me several times” although no voice messages appear on my mobile. Regardless of whether they called and mailed a hundred times, neither Expedia nor Saudia managed to establish contact and left us to check in to our outbound leg at LHR and embark on our journey without any kind of knowledge of the problem that was waiting to unfold.To think that Saudia ground staff said nothing to us about the issue when we checked in for the outbound leg at LHR amazes me, as surely the easy failsafe option for ensuring contact was to put a flag in the airline booking. By the way, did I mention we are travelling in Business Class at some considerable expense? This in my opinion should not matter as the fundamental principle here should apply regardless of cabin booked.I noticed the problem on Saturday when I dipped into email to pull up some work messages using search item “reschedule”, which then returned the 2 emails in my spam folder. I called Expedia but was told in no uncertain terms the problem was with Saudia and I had to deal with them. I then spent over an hour on my mobile dealing with several layers of Saudia’s customer service team only to be told that no options existed other than a partial refund. The supervisor did finally say however that the support Helpdesk had the ability to book us on an alternative carrier but that no telephone number for them existed but that an email would see the team kick into action. Well that email was sent some 48 hrs ago now and there has been zero response. I have also direct-messaged Saudia on Twitter expressing my desire to resolve the matter without resorting to public tweeting etc. I was contacted 24 hrs later with a message that my concern had been “routed to the appropriate team”. But 24 hrs further on and no further updates.I therefore decided to escalate within Saudia as surely they would want to accommodate a family travelling business class currently stranded on account of their own schedule change? I sent my email on to the CEO Jaan Albrecht, who is reported in the aviation press to be on a mission to “transform Saudia into a global carrier and restore the glory days”. However 36 hrs on and no response either from Mr Albrecht or his team. Even if he is on leave or drowned in email, I am sure someone is monitoring his email so the lack of response suggests a lack of desire to resolve this matter.So, with our check out only 3 days away, I now have no option but to take this matter public, starting here on TripAdvisor but also extending to Twitter, Linked-In and Facebook as well as aviation Press if necessary.My only goal is to ensure passage home for myself, my wife and my teenage daughter, a contract which we had in place with Saudia and Expedia. Space exists on several carriers for the travel date in question, which I listed in my original Email to Saudia support on Saturday wherein my ask was simply that they move us onto one of those flights - something which I am sure they have the ability in customer services to do.I truly hope this note will spark the relevant parties into action and enable a solution to be confirmed today so that we can stop worrying about this problem and enjoy the remaining days of our holiday.I WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM APPENDING TO THIS REVIEW WITH POSITIVE NEWS IF SAUDIA DO INDEED FINALLY RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT CURRENTLY THIS SEEMS UNLIKELY","April 8, 2018",1,Date of travel: April 2018,Male,5,1,5,5,5,3,3,3
1367,saudia_airlines,Disappointing,"IFEs didn't work at all. Food was OK. I hope that they strictly impose seat selection for passengers who travel with a partner if they want to be seated together instead of asking a solo passenger who took the time to choose his preferred seat then asked to move to another to give way to a couple/family. Ground services are so-so, I had an e-visa on a print out but was asked to stay behind as the staff doesn't seem to be too familiar how a hard copy e-visa looks like.

I went to washroom, opened the door and moved back. Filth and stench was overwhelming. Service an the plane was good. Drinks served all time, 3 times food. As this is Saudi airline i notices some particularities. Obviously no alcohol. Movies were censored. Women naked arms and also crosses - even in the cementary - were ""smudged -out"" in all movie scenes. One complain was long wait for the baggage in Toronto.

Saudia staff did not keep customers updated, leaving staff from other airlines trying to help out. Needless to say this annoyed all passengers waiting to embark. When Saudia staff did turn up they all thought it was very funny. Passengers did not. In-flight entertainment mediocre and limited to a single small screen every 5 rows of seats. Food edible but tasteless and of poor quality. Saudia is cheap, but this flight seemed cheaper than most. Frankly as the national carrier of Saudi Arabia I'd expect far better from them!

1371,saudia_airlines,Expectations Surpassed,"I booked with Saudia because of the price; it was about 150-200 USD cheaper than the next non-direct flight. I had some hesitations with using this airline as per reviews, but given the fact that we were on budget and I am okay with budget airlines service, then this should be okay. Ground Check-in in Manila was not fast. We were only like 1h away from boarding time but we were still in the check-in line (which supposedly be the check in gates closing time). Nonetheless, we were able to board the plane.We boarded big planes from Manila to Riyadh and from Jeddah to Manila as well from Saudi to Turkey. The seats were comfortable, leg room was okay. They provided a kit comprising of sleeping pads, socks, toothbrush, toothpaste. They also provide earplugs in a sealed plastic (makes me wonder if they are one time use only, but it does seem to be). The TV screen was of similar size to other airlines I have tried. Movie selections were also good (not very latest, but at least decent to watch). Food was served twice (mnl-saudi) and once on saudi to turkey, vv. It was actually something I can eat (for someone not a fan of curry-based food) and I remember 1 or 2 meals that were actually very palatable. No juices/specialty drinks being served, only coffee and tea.I had no baggage issues. Only in Manila airport, they were able to open my luggage (but I guess its the Manila customs is at fault here)Airline crew: Mixed reactions here. There were friendly staff and there were slightly not very friendly. But on overall, they are still helpful. My only complaint will be the one experience in Jeddah, when our flight to Manila was delayed and there was no proper info. The process here was also relatively disorganized.

1380,saudia_airlines,Worst airport and airline ,"Started with an email about them moving our travel date and they needed us to confirm the changes. Hubby dealt with it as what they offering us is impossible to catch our connecting flight. This made loss one day wages as we have to fly a day early and spend a night in the hotel in Manila to catch our domestic flight the next day as we are one day early. My husband wasn’t very pleased and asked the process to complaint but unfortunately he’s been given a wrong name of staff and a wrong advise on how to put his complain. Anyway that’s the first thing, Secondly we landed in Jeddah “King Abdulaziz airport” the most unorganised, filthy and small airport. One gate is for 5 destination flight and you won’t know when and where you’ll be called out for boarding, people throw rubbish in front of them as if it’s normal and toilets seems no one who cleans and put tissue. You wouldn’t think it is like that when you know Saudi is not a third world country. Thirdly my husband only drink when he’s on holiday or on a long haul flight but we realise they don’t serve alcohol throughout the flight. Everything is just so disappointing. A long journey so tiring and all we wanted is a smooth flow of waiting on our flight and not a chaos and stressful flight. Definitely won’t be using it again.

The planes sometimes can have faults which of course can happen on any airline but I am surprised that this has never been the case on my flying to or from Riyadh. The staff are always courteous and are a pleasure to deal with. I personally like the prayer that is read on board the plane when flying. Domestically Saudi Airlines is uncomparable.

Our layover in Jeddah was about 4 hours and we did not need the visa. On our return flight we had two layovers in Saudi, one in Madina and the second in Jeddah, neither of them being more than a couple of hours. When we tried to check in on the day of our return flight, we were rudely told that we needed transit visas because we were flying domestically in Saudi. We would need to purchase a different ticket with only one layover in Saudi. The new tickets would cost $1400. We pleaded with the airlines to help us but they refused. We even went to the airport office for Saudia airlines to speak with management, but they would not listen nor be compassionate about our situation. We ended up purchasing tickets on another airline, but it still cost us an additional $1000. I will never EVER use Saudia Airlines again.

I didn't enjoy their inflight food unfortunately thought it would be better. Younger children receive a activity pack in a nice little backpack. We had to transfer on to domestic flight at Riyad Airport, we had to collect luggage and pick up a bus to take us to different terminal to catch our connecting flight. Not great to run around with checked in luggage again!!! I think the 3 and half hr transfer time was pretty much used up in passport control and collection of visa and return of them!. On return journey from Jeddah which was a very small airport and passport control upstairs was ridiculous with seating areas and queues for this all merging. chaotic. On arrival at heathrow, disembarkation was quick and easy as well as passport control . However, waiting for our luggage became a nightmare, we were told a few flights were on our belt after waiting an hr!! we enquired again and was told to go to lost property. who told us the luggage may have not left Saudia as they have had this problem before!! we were a large group travelling together, and we all had our individual luggage so how many forms and how long was that going to take again!! by this time our luggage started to arrive!! over an hr later. My pick up taxi that was prebooked kept calling me and was getting annoyed. Had to pay extra charges. Thanks Saudia Airlines.

What stands out in the Saudi airline is the wide economy class seats. The staff members are nice and helpful from check-in to leaving the aircraft. Not a lot of variety of food and drink on such a short flight but I cannot complain. The only downside of Saudi airline flights which are not specific for this one is the frequent interruption of entertainment by announcements. Some of them are obligatory such as safety videos. But to interrupt the program to announce sky sales or the presence a prayer room in the back among other things in addition to repeating everything in two languages is a little too much. Once your choice of entertainment program kicks in, an unduly long add starts. If you have started the program before the safety announcement, your screen will restart from the very beginning after the announcement is done.","February 27, 2018",4,Date of travel: February 2018,Riyadh,5,4,4,3,4,3,4,4

We were told that there might have been a confusion as our final destination was Riyadh and were requested to take our next flight to Riyadh and collect the baggage in Riyadh. When I reached Riyadh, I still could not locate my baggage and again went to the counter for assistance. I was told that the baggage had gone missing and was requested to fill in a lost baggage form. I finally received an SMS notification about my baggage being found after 2 days and had to go all the way to Riyadh airport to collect it as they did not have a facility to deliver it at my home or work place.

Our flight was delayed by an hour and when I saw the plane it was in the air going to Manila. Then I checked my flight status and checked that it was a 777-300ER, and not just any but HZ-AK31, which came from LAX. So the lounge was really great. You could order almost anything. Then when they announced for boarding, we left the lounge and went to the plane in ""Business"" style. Our seats were 1A,C and 2A,C. The first thing I saw was that Saudia had done well in Business Class over a few years ; they had some woodwork done with huge tables and a huge screen ( smaller than Emirates though) etc. The crew was really friendly.

I was upgraded to First Suite with my minimum bid and it was an amazing experience on this very long flight (approx. 16 hours and 40 minutes). Some of the great services you get why flying with SAUDIA First Suite is the personalized travel experience by having a chef to serve you the food you like, the privacy in your Suite and most importantly the flat bed that provides you with a comfortable sleeping during this long flight. The in-flight entertainment was great too although it didn’t work smoothly in some parts of the journey. I personally loved the pajama they provided to me to have a worry free sleep even though it was way larger than my size but really helped me enjoy the sleep. I hanged my clothing on a hanger inside my Suite.I was such a wonderful flight and a pleasant experience.

However in domestic flights there is no alternative, so I have to use it, because it is the best of the worst. Last week I went to riyadh from jeddah and came back to jeddah the next day. Business class as usual. First disapointmet was whrn I found my seat leg support was broken half way. I call the steward and he apologized to me and said this seat should have been blocked by the system because it is under maintenance!.?. By the way this is the newest airoplane 787. I had to squuze my selt to sit till the plane took off. Then they found another seat (isle seat) which I don,t like. My previous seat was 1A window seat. Then IAsked the steward to get me more coffee after they finish their routine, and he ignored me. I did not have the meal but I was waiting for tthe coffee till we landed. Two days ago I flew to Abha and tthe same attitude from the crew was repeeated..again this waas business classs trip. Saudia is spending billions on it,s planes and technology, but God kows how much the spend on their staff both ground services such as maintenance or front desks or their flying crews. All of them have very common charactes. The. Last thing they care about is the customer satisfaction. If I was in any authority I will send screening team to each flight and office as reqular customers and ask for full assessment of each staff and clean the mess.

I was shocked and i could not believe the fact that happened in the first day of the New year. I made a report at the Airport when i arrived to Dubai. The customer service said that they will contact me when they find my bag. They promised me that everything will be just fine. I was fine with that. I really want to have my bag back safely, it has so many items that means a lot to me, also my clothes and other stuff.  The customer service got back to me within a 1 week telling me that they still looking for my bag. I was really frustrated that it took them so long to tell me they still did not find it. A week after they send me an email asking me to fill out a detailed list of my lost items with the price of each item, and the description of my lost bag. I did what they ask for by sending an email back to them with the itemized list plus a picture of my lost bag . They replied back with an email saying that the Saudi airline is going to give me a refund , which i refuse to take it because is a way too less compare to the real cost of my lost items.I was really disappointed that such a huge company like Saudi airline is not fair with its customer. They really ruined my new year, and they wasted my all vacation time where i should be enjoying it with family and friendsThe big choking surprise is when i received an email from the Saudia Airline stating that my claim has been processed and refunded. I really want to make it clear that Arabia airline and I never made a final agreement . I just want a justification from the Arabia Airline explaining to me why they did this on my behalf , know that i never signed or except any deal from them.Arabia Airline  Please advise and help me ???!!Above is my reference number.

There was not even a single crayon on board so that the kids could maybe draw something. No this was not an overnight flight. It was 11am..as in, in the morning. In fact even a pre-flight warning would have been useful, then one could have prepared adequately. But the worst was yet to come. About a couple of hours into the flight the sink in the bathroom was clogged and could no longer be used. Apparently this was a regular occurrence and the flight staff were unfazed by this. I can confirm the same happened on my return flight. Water is not on offer despite the numerous research articles that advocate staying hydrated on a long flight. You have to beg it out of the staff. By the second half of the flight there was no longer any caffeinated fizzy drink on offer as the staff claimed it was finished (in what I am sure is their attempt at preventing a complete toilet disaster midair). My dad was meant to be an assisted passenger. But it seemed assisted with this airline is interpreted as tortured.

1502,saudia_airlines,Surprisingly Good,"Flight started on time, and to my surprise there was indian crew serving the flight to JED. It was a great experience, but due to the rush of passengers going for religious visit (UMRA) the flight seemed to be a little choco bloc. But nonetheless there are smart people at the airline check-in counters who look out for people with a good profile, they allot them better seats and I happened to be given 30J if I remember it right, it was a perfect 1st row of the economy section and the one with the best leg room.They are not like other international carriers who will offer you an upgrade to a higher tier i.e. Biz if you seem to be a well dressed classy individual and standing out from the rest. But it is worth a trip or two, plus if you are flying from India or flying into India be rest assured, that you will have indian crew hosting you on the flight and you will have good Indian food.Do not worry if you are a vegetarian as they offer good vegetarian good as well.Arrive on time for the check in at the counters at Mumbai airport, as the crowd is usually alot as this is the last flight out to Saudi and also they operate wide body aircrafts and pilgrims are the ones who flock at these airlines, so you can expect a good amount of people ahead of you.It is a short flight with 5 hours of flight time and you will barely realise the duration getting over once you have a meal sip on some tea and doze off, and in no time its landing at JED airport.One tip, be well behaved with the crew, as the Indian crew operates this sector, brace yourself to be taken to task really well if you land up doing something stupid on the flight.","January 13, 2018",4,Date of travel: November 2017,"Mumbai, India",4,4,3,4,5,4,4,5

It took one of our group to go find the manager and complain, upon which they chartered a flight.After 8 hours, a guy came and literally dumped a box of water near us so we could get a drink.Once we eventually got to Dammam only one of our four suitcases arrived, so next day we had to go back to the airport as the Saudi Air staff were not even remotely interested, Anyone who has been to Saudi will not be surprised by such arrogance.There are many regional airlines that come highly recommended, Saudi Air is NOT one of them.","January 12, 2018",1,Date of travel: October 2017,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",4,1,2,3,4,2,1,1

After about 25 minutes following the seat belt sign going out, I ended up getting up to ask for some water. Should not have been necessary.

As we were bringing insulin for my dad which needs to be refrigerated, the staff provided us with ice. By the time the plane lands, it melted and the bag was dripping with water. The female staff were not trained to avoid touching male passengers. The facilities were good. Each seat has it’s own screen. Lots of videos and games to occupy the time. There’s also a real time tracking notification on screen. Food was below average. Once, I was not given a bread to spread the butter. The tray was also cramped and slanted on one side so the food kept sliding away. A hint at how the plane was maintained. But the staff kept offering drinks during the flight which was a great thing.

Unfortunately it wasn’t well specified in the main luggage page, only if you do a good search on the website. Unlucky I guess.A couple hours later I found out my flight was delayed, with no help or information from the stressed out team members at the airport.As this wasn’t enough when I got to my final destination my luggage and my surfboards were nowhere to be seen. (I wasn’t very surprised to be honest)At the airport I was told that my stuff should be delivered to me in a maximum of 2 days and I was handled 75$ so I could buy some basic stuff as the only thing I had were the cloths I was wearing. 2 days after my arrival I received a call from Saudia saying that the next flight that would bring my luggage would only be in 5 days! That would let me 7 days, a whole week of my holidays with absolutely nothing. Spending 20 euros a day with surfboards rental, when I had to pay 135 to travel with my own.After sending an massive complaint email I received a call from them saying that my luggage would be delivered in the next morning, less the 12 hours. So they were lying to me.There was a paper on my bag saying that my bag was sent to my final destination one day after my flight, but someone crossed with a pen and wrote the date I was informed by the company.So even with all the nightmare that it was flying with Saudia, they still lied to me, trying to leave me a whole week without anything, just to save some pennies.After all I asked a man called Lakmali Ranasinghe for a refund of the extra luggage I had to pay for my surfboards, I was told that the concerned department would call me to assist me with my claim.Surprise! I never got the callAn absolutely disgrace, never flying with Saudia again.Ps.

1531,saudia_airlines,"Their own rules, not those of all the other countries","We will not travel with them again. We do not agree that they are the exception to the whole world. We are used to buying products in the duty free shops of departure whenever we travel (perfumes, chocolates, alcohol ...) which in the airport shops are sealed very carefully in case you are in transit. We were traveling from Europe to Manila with a bit more than an hour's stop in Saudi Arabia. As soon as we got to the transit zone, they separated us, took us to different rooms, we were treated like terrorists for more than an hour, and all because they wanted to remove a bottle of wine that was perfectly sealed and that had as final destination a different country. Therefore Saudia can not transport Westerners and become a hub! Neither when you travel with Emirates nor with Qatar Airways you have these problems, or similar ones. Not only they do not offer a glass of wine to accompany your dinner, but they do not let you transport it even if you bought it in your country's dutyfree shop. Now we know that this company has this problem and we are not interested in these impositions. They can not compete with Emirates or Qatar, where you can travel as you would in any other company in the free world... In addition to that, boarding is a disaster. They changed the departure gate at the last minute without warning, there are not enough seats in the lounge nor space (overcrowding that even becomes dangerous) ...","December 22, 2017",1,Date of travel: November 2017,"Madrid, Spain",4,2,3,1,4,2,4,1

They darken the cabin (dark filters in every window, there is no choice) and the flight personnel takes the chance to disappear because they understand you will be sleeping all the flight. Can't they offer a snack (ice cream, noodle soup, nuts... whatever)? I remember they passed by offering water only once. So if you fly with Saudia and do not sleep for 8 hours in between meals, bring a snack with you. And, of course, no alcohol is allowed in so do not try to take your own beers into the plane, you must know that everybody will be frisked at the boarding gate!

So, I expected some improvements.I was quite pleased with all the checking in and boarding which were hassle free. The overhead compartments were roomy enough to take up all the passengers' hand luggage and most in our group had the 20 inch luggage.My husband and our 9 year old girl were seated at the front row, which was very convenient for them to move around while our 11 year old girl and I were seated at a row behind them. Entertainment was non-existence so that was quite a setback for my children but what made it worse for me was that the LCD monitor in front of my face was flickering the whole time making sleeping almost impossible that I had to hang my blanket to cover it.There was no reading materials offered and the inflight magazine was 85% in Arabic. Apart from the emergency evacuation literature, there was nothing else to read.Food was reasonably good and served with smiles. My children who are usually picky, finished their food so that was a good sign. The cakes stay fresh even though we only consumed them 3 hours after getting off the plane. They served good quality juice too.The cleanliness of the lavatory was of acceptable standard.The pilot handled it very well when we had to go through quite a bad weather before landing.

The only negative Side of this Company are the long connectins between one flight to another.But Let me tell you something: I was flight from Milan to Ryadh and from Ryadh to Trivandrum in india and same thing on the way back for only 400E!The only bad thing were the 10 hours of connection flight in Ryadh airport, this airport compared to other bad review that I've read, is a very good airport full of services!In both terminals there are these Welcome lounge where with 30E you can stay 6h and inside is full of brand new couches, super wifi connection, plugs for all nationalities, an all inclusive restaurant and bar so during these 6h you can eat and drink whatever you like.In addition you can have with other 30h one room to sleep for 4h!!!So even if you have to wait all those hours the time will fly because is perfectly organized this Apt! TRY THIS COMPANY! I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT!PS SERVICES PRICE AND BAGGAGE ALLOWENCE ARE JUST PERFECT !","December 19, 2017",5,Date of travel: November 2017,,5,5,5,4,5,3,5,4
1537,saudia_airlines,Surprisingly good experience,"I've never flown business class before, so maybe I'm easily pleased, but I was pleasantly surprised by Saudia. I booked a business class fare from Rome to Jakarta for $770AUD, because it was the same price as economy on other airlines. Then, when I read the reviews, I started to think I'd made a bad decision. Not so.The first leg was on an older airbus. The seat was huge and really comfortable, but didn't recline fully. Staff were friendly. Fresh strawberry juice, hot towel and coffee and dates to start with. Interesting menu, with a selection of Arabian and western choices.Some problems with the entertainment system, but I ended up have a long chat to the lovely young Saudi man next to me, so time flew. I enjoyed getting an inside view of Saudi Arabia.Riyadh airport was also better than expected, and the Saudia lounge was quite impressive. More delicious food. The only problem was that it was very crowded and all the comfortable seats were taken.For smokers, the lounge has its own smoking room, that had a very good filtration system, so not as disgusting as most.On the Riyadh to Jakarta leg, the 777 plane was more modern and had fully flat seats. I slept most of the flight, which was the point, so didn't try the entertainment system. I'd definitely fly Saudia business class again. In fact, it's ruined me for economy class! Just hope I can find such a good deal again.","December 17, 2017",4,Date of travel: December 2017,"Fremantle, Australia",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1538,saudia_airlines,Only Good If You intend To Sleep,"Despite the title, it was not even comfortable to begin with. But yes, I did sleep for at least half of the 8 hour journey.Most of the LCD monitors were not working and there we were staring at the blank screen, with not even a flicker. No books or magazines were in offer (even the in flight magazine were not available at every seat). There were rubbish from previous flights not picked up from the seats' storage pockets. I cannot imagine when was the last time they vacuumed the place. Air sickness bags were not replenished and we had 2 passengers asking for them but the air stewardess were very slow to provide them.The toilets were nit regularly checked and the paper bin was overflowed. Food was terrible (badly served by rude stewardess, dinner rolls were almost stale, cakes were dry, vegetables were overcooked, rice for dinner was over-boiled and for breakfast was dry, no plain water was given with the package and tea was only served much later - one could choke!). Group checking in was chaotic but thank God the immigration process were very efficient.The flight crew could use with more smiles and more proficient English and/or Arabic.

1539,saudia_airlines,Worthless customer service,"What an unfortunate thing it was to book a ticket with Saudia Airline. I had to cancel my flight for personal reasons and I was looking forward to have my allowed refundable amount by the airline. I called the company and the customer service personnel were clueless and rude. They told me that they would send me an update regarding my claim in four to six weeks (positive or negative outcome). They never did. I called them six weeks later and they were still particularly unpleasant and nothing came out of that conversation. After that, I’ve sent them three emails requesting my allowed refundable amount and each of the got denied with no explanation at all. I called for a third time and it was always the same unpleasant and clueless voice. I felt like I fell in a bureaucratic trap that they’ve created just to make me confuse so they won’t have to work any further on my case. I’ve took the plane more than 50 times in my life and I’ve never had that much trouble before.

1563,saudia_airlines,Worst treatment of passengers ,"I took Saudia Airline to go for Umrah. Business was their best class available on the route. Needless to say it was the worst experience. The crew on the ground was horrible at both ends. They mistreated passengers just because the know people are bound to perform holy visit without any other choice. They made business class passengers board from economy side, and used the economy shuttle from departure lounge to plane, which was over packed with ill-mannered personnel and passengers. In the plane airline crew (off and on duty) were taking up many of the business class seats. Electronics barely worked and legroom was lacking. Some other fishy stuff went on like one seat was curtained throughout the flight and just before landing a male and a female crew member came out of it. Food was substandard. I recommend one should use NON-Saudia airline when going for Umrah, however, there isn’t much you can do to avoid the mistreatment of passengers once you are on the ground in Saudi Arabia. They may have an excuse of handling mass crowds but when I pay for business class it is not just about the in air quality of service but overall end to end experience. They have the money and resources to fix this if they really want. Very unfortunate to experience all this on the airline, which represents one of the richest countries.

I was absolutely livid as this had been done with out my (the passenger's) consent. I complained to the cabin manager when I got to the destination. I asked why did he do it at night as I already had difficulty seeing out through the window before the Sun had even come up. He said it was because people were sleeping. I couldn't believe I was hearing this. When I went to school it used to be dark at night and I believe it still is, so why the need to dim the windows when it is dark anyway? Totally vacuous thinking to say the least. I further complained that he had ruined the enjoyment of my flight experience and that they should desist from such behavior in future.

You cannot go back to ticketing area to change your ticket if you are transiting. Plus, people stare at you funny when you are a woman and not wearing a scarf, a lady in the bathroom started harassing me in Arabic motioning me to cover up my hair.

1581,saudia_airlines,Better than expected!,"I read a lot of comments on here before flying that made me second guess my decision to buy tickets on Saudia. But I'm happy to say that they exceeded my expectations. First, the plane was in great shape - definitely a newish model and I felt safe. I had read one comment that said that the planes were so old that they still had seat ashtrays in them. Not true. Secondly, the in-flight entertainment was great -- yes, they blur cleavage and edit out sex scenes, but there's plenty of enjoyable options. There was only one time where I was like, wait, did I just miss a few minutes of plot? The food is probably the biggest downside. The meals are rice or beef on a bed of rice. The side desserts,bread rolls and salads are not great -- I didn't touch them. I was not expecting them to be good so I packed snacks, but on such a long flight good food is appreciated. Definitely no alcohol on board so if you can't deal with that this definitely is not the airline for you. We were one of only two American families on board, but there were no strange looks or any feelings of discomfort. We had a seven hour layover in Jeddah on the way there and in Riyadh on the way home. The Jeddah airport is pretty dismal, but we were on our way to a great vacation so lots of games of hangman and twenty questions got us through. There is a small transit lounge you can sit in while in Jeddah where they have juice and coffee and a bathroom with an actual toilet. Stay in there instead of going to the main terminal. The main terminal bathrooms are awful and the noise level and the constant announcements are atrocious -- serious sensory overload. Riyadh has a lounge we could access with our credit card and the lounge had sleeping pods which were seriously fantastic. I don't know that we could have stay there all night without them. So, overall, not bad, an experience for sure, and if it saves you lots of money, I'd say worth it if it means being able to take the trip or not.","November 26, 2017",3,Date of travel: October 2017,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",3,4,4,2,3,3,4,4

1589,saudia_airlines,"Horrible experience, avoid like the plague","Religion should not be a factor in international travel with a global airline. Entertainment is so heavily censored to Saudi Arabian standards that there essentially isn't any. American sitcoms, for example, censor out all swearing, references to sex and alcohol, hugging/cuddling, kissing, and they even blur over any exposed flesh - e.g. shoulders and even lower legs! As a westerner I find this offensive - provide an uncensored version of the entertainment system for non-Saudi travelers if they want it. Even ignoring all that though the choice is VERY limited compared to other large airlines - hardly any new films. Same selection on all 4 of our flights as well, which totaled almost 30 hours. Very disappointing. The severity of the strict dress code on board is completely ridiculous. As a woman you have to be completely covered, and in loose fitting clothing - so no leggings/tight trousers. I wore a floor length skirt and a long sleeved top, which is genuinely really quite uncomfortable for a long haul flight. Whilst I was prepared to have to dress this way whilst in Saudi Arabia Airport, I wasn't prepared for it to be the case for 20 hours of straight travelling, and again, I find having this forced upon me quite offensive. My partner (male) wore shorts as it was a night flight and he wanted to be comfortable, he found out he wouldn't be allowed on board and so had to BUY trousers. You aren't even allowed to take shoes off, you have to sleep in shoes?! Saudi Arabia airport transfer lounge is genuinely one of the worst places I have ever been in my whole life. It, in itself means you should VERY seriously reconsider traveling with this airline, especially as a young western woman. The toilets are like an incoming apocalypse, honestly, it's nearly impossible to describe just how bad they are. There are essentially no shops, it's crowded to dangerous levels, to the extent that if there was a fire or an emergency of any type, people genuinely would be crushed to death. It's actually hard to even find a seat, and there is absolutely no where quiet to go, even the first class lounge is heaving. There are no restaurants, just very understocked, underwhelming cafes. The aircon and ventilation is also appalling, it's stifling to overwhelming levels. Men and women also can't go through security together, so my partner and I got separated for a while, which was also quite distressing when I couldn't find him for half an hour. Honestly, avoid this place like the plague.The food and drink choice on board is extremely limited as well. I do understand and can forgive the no-alcohol policy. However, some more food options than 'beef and rice' or 'chicken and rice' would be welcome over the course of 6 meals...! If you, like me, tend to get a bit dehydrated on flights, then make sure to take a couple of bottles of water on board as they are very stingy at providing drinks. On a positive note all four flights were on the brand new Dreamliner planes, which were beautiful and seemed quite spacious in comparison to other long-haul flights I have been on.","November 13, 2017",1,Date of travel: August 2017,"North Yorkshire, United Kingdom",3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1

However unfortunately there is no aerobridge so you have to take a bus to your waiting plane. If you are lucky you will get a premium bus with larger seats covered in leather.SV123 is a B787-9 plane, the latest addition to the fleet. I was pleasantly surprised by the seating configuration for business class which was based on reverse herringbone 1-2-1 configuration and I got a window seat on port side. The slanting seat and high divider means you have all the privacy afforded by the plane. There are lots of flat surfaces, pockets and crevices to store your goods. Most importantly this is a real flat bed seat!The customary qahwa and sukkary dates greet you on board together with hot towels.Dinner was good with plenty of appetiser, salad, desserts and of course the main course. I had the lamb kabsa that smells so good from the galley. I dont need to think long what the main course would be.After dinner, getting ready for sleep, I made a mental note what is available: blanket, mattress, pillow, eye cover, ear plugs but no pyjamas. Neverthelesa not a biggie and I sunk into deep sleep helped by the supplied eye cover and ear plugs and was only waken up by the stewardess for breakfast. Wished I was given a couple more hours.

The service was generally good, even providing two meals for the longer flights while the other airlines usually only provide a meal and a snack. Unlike some other airlines as well, they also provided discounted rates for youths going to the UK.Despite the good on-flight service, the transit in Jeddah left a lot to be desired. The airport did not offer much of anything (not much shops, not even a proper prayer room despite being in Saudia) and the staff was pretty rude. Meals were provided for long transit but noone informed us (instead we were basically shooed out of the 'full' lounge) and we only knew because some other passengers told us. The unsatisfactory transit in Jeddah really brought down my rating for the flight. Despite that, the flight itself was actually one of the best flights I've flown in and I do recommend flying Saudia if you don't think you'll mind the transit.","November 1, 2017",3,Date of travel: October 2017,"London, United Kingdom",3,3,4,4,3,4,4,3
1597,saudia_airlines,worst experience regardless of class of travel,"I've traveled both Business and Economy class for various sectors with Saudia and I must say that regardless of the class of travel, the service is just plain terrible. The attitude of the flight attendants (especially the male staff) is deplorable. They are usually uninterested in serving you and rarely ever smile, REGARDLESS of class of service. Its almost like they are being forced to work and they put no effort in being amiable. The seats are not particularly comfortable and seem worn out and tired. The bathrooms have a certain stink to them and are not the cleanest. The food is so-so. On this same leg, I had an Air France flight from YUL to CDG, and the food was actually pretty good for economy, however, the same cannot be said for Saudia, unfortunately.

1599,saudia_airlines,Saudia Need to Better train their cabin crew,"The experience of travelling with Saudia, which I do regularly, is very mixed. On this flight the check in and boarding started early, approx 50 mins before flight time, which I thought was very positive for an on time departure. The leg room on this flight was comfortable and each seat had a TV screen. I boarded at 9.45 for a 10.40 flight. Ten mins after boarding I requested a set of ear pieces so I could watch the in flight entertainment only to be told no, you only get these after take off. Eventually at 11.10 I was given a set, an hour and 25 mins after boarding, certainly not good customer service.We left the stand on time but as often happens in Dubai airport we sat on the apron for almost 30 minutes waiting for our turn to take off. If I could I would avoid using Dubai airport as the flight service here continues to dis-improve as the airport gets busier. While we waited for take off we had to watch one of the cabin crew struggling to stay awake in his seat, a sight that does not give confidence to passengers.The food is just okay with no tea or coffee provided.As we taxied for take off several passenger phones were ringing and there was no reminder to switch them off. When we landed many passengers were on their feet before the plane had come to a halt and instead of verbally requesting passengers to stay seated the flight attendant just waved his arms.

They were accommodating enough if you got up and asked, but doing that 17 times during a 17 hour travel time is boring, they should bring it to the seats.Constant unwanted interruptions over the PA system, some of which I found oppressive and made me feel uncomfortable. Films are edited.Plane made an unscheduled stop at Jeddah, why wasn't that on the ticket? Presume they wanted to change the crew and pick up more passengers on a relatively empty plane. Again I could live with that, but we just sat on the tarmac, with no offer of refreshments or real explanation of what was going on.My strongest advice is do not listen to ground staff at LHR concerning advice about taking duty free alcohol through Saudi when transiting. If security find it in your hand luggage, even sealed, it'll cause issues beyond reasonable belief, as was my bitter experience.I would not recommend to anyone they use this airline, I would pay more and use a more neutral airline that respects that the values and religious beliefs of individuals can differ quite widely.","October 28, 2017",1,Date of travel: October 2017,,5,1,0,0,5,2,4,0

No one was reachable and my calls were not answered. I then had to resort to calling long distance to the Canadian/US lines and was told they could not help me, as their rule is that if you book online you must then cancel it online. Their online system was malfunctioning and would not send my phone number the pin it needed to cancel. I explained that to them thoroughly and was still told that they cannot do anything to help me. This was all within the 24 hrs I would need to cancel without penalty. I continued to call for help and was merely informed that if I wanted to cancel by phone then they would have to charge me the cancellation fee, as I had booked online. They could not connect me to their tech support to fix the flitch, nor could they connect me to their local office to see if they can help. Although they could see the obvious glitch, that I was within the 24 hrs, and their ability to pull up and cancel my ticket the customer service refused to help me without charging me the cancellation fee. This entire ordeal took up the entire night. The next morning I call them again and ask for help yet again, to be told YET AGAIN that there is nothing they can do for me. My only option was to email the techs and see if anyone can get back to me before the 24 hrs are up with a pin so that I could cancel the flight myself online. If no one got back to me, and if I didn't cancel by phone and forfeit half what I paid as the cancellation penalty, then I would lose everything I'd paid. Long story short no one ever got back to me from tech, I waited all day until the last hour and was forced to call in and cancel the ticket by phone and lose what I'd paid.

I wasn't feeling Ok in the flight & ask for a comforter so that I can sleep. The answer was they don't carry comforter for this flight. Afterwards, I also request for the earplug to flight stewards. Again she told me they don't carry such an item. I was shocked to hear the response. The food was absolutely worst. Boiled rice without any chicken called ""BIRIYANI"" It's a six & half hour flight & I was extremely hungry. Flight stewards were extremely rude & weren't helping out elderly people having a hard time placing their carry on luggage in the overhead compartment. From Jeddah to Toronto was another chaos. I had six-hour halt in Jeddah to catch my next flight to Toronto, Canada. I wanted to switch my seat & seeking for help from Saudi airline ground CSR agent. I was directed to three different agents. Finally, I was told they cant help me now. seat plan can be changed right before entering the aircraft. I tried to explain it would be too late because by then all the seats will be assigned. I may not get the one I desire. But they insist me to wait. Finally, about an hour before the departure they made an announcement to gather the passenger for a final security check before on board. After the security check, I couldn't find any agent who can assist me to change my seat. I saw ground staff were waiting & checking our passport & ticket before getting to an overcrowded Bus. That bus took us to the aircraft after 10 minutes of bumpy ride. It was thirteen & half hour flight from Jeddah to Toronto. We were served 2 meal one breakfast & other lunch. In both occasions, we were given no choice at all except offering a vegetarian meal. When I asked for a non-veg meal the answer was ""we don't have it"" with a nasty attitude.Instead, i was offered a dry piece of bread with a piece of cheddar cheese, Which called ""Cheese sandwich.

Luggage allowance is 2 bags on all routes which is a HUGE plus.The aircraft was new and clean and felt nice to be in. Seating was 2 x 4 x 2 which i think is another big advantage especially if you are travelling as a couple. They had a nice big TV in every seat and the entertainment options seemed adequate for a not so long haul flight.Pillows, blankets were provided and the service staff on board were very polite and smiling.Quality of food was good on both to and fro journeys, however the menu wasn't too exciting.Bathrooms were clean mostly and well stocked with amenities.They have a small area at the back of the aircraft to pray, which is really great if you just need to sit down or stretch your legs for a while.They were happy to serve drinks and water throughout the duration of the flight.Quite a pleasant journey for us.","September 21, 2017",4,Date of travel: September 2017,,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,4
1618,saudia_airlines,"""Tortuous and terrible Check-in ever""","I returned from my umra in July,2017 by Saudi Airlines with my Wife & we are 60+.The journey from the start was horrible. As Soo as we came to Jeddah Airport, we searched for trolleys to take the luggage,but none in sight. We saw a man hoarding a bunch of trolleys and giving it for 10 Riyyals each and everybody was paying him & getting the trolley. This is disgusting for an international Airport. This is not new, I am facing it every year for the past five years.Will the authorities remedy the situation. No international Airport sells trolleys to passengers.Then for the checkin we were forced to wait for one hour outside the entrance of the Jeddah Airport and my Wife almost swooned.At last we were allowed inside and pushed through for another half an hour inside to get the boarding pass & clear immigration. The flight slated for 10:20 was delayed for more than one hour with no news of when it will actually start and with no semblance of any regret. It looked as if they are giving a free trip to everybody.Once we entered the flight the in flight service was good and pleasant. But the bitter taste of boarding the flight is still lingering. Hope good sense will prevail and the Airlines will take care of its passengers who are on a religious tour in a more humane manner & also maintain punctuality.

1635,saudia_airlines,New York to Dhaka (Round Trip),"I flew with Saudi Airlines on my way back from vacation in Bangladesh to my hometown in New York. This was the worst airline experience I have ever had. Before leaving on vacation, Saudi Airlines informed me that on my return flight back they had pushed back my flight one day, but my connecting flight remained the same day, which meant I would have to stay in the airport at Riyadh for around 30 hours. I asked them if they would provide any hotel service like any regular airline, but they denied stating that the airline didn't provide such accommodations. I was astonished as I had 4 other members with me, including a wheelchair 80-year old passenger who could not even sleep through the whole night outside of a bed, let alone sit down in an airport for 30 hours. When I asked what I should do, Saudi Airlines' office in New York told me that I could only take a refund, which was not a viable option as it was only a few days before my outbound flight and finding a flight this time would be near to impossible. When I went to Saudi Airlines' office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, I was greeted by excellent customer service. The manager informed me that I could get a transit visa and go outside of the airport in Riyadh and book my own hotel, which would all be at my own expense. In total, I spent nearly $2000 in order to get the transit visa, book a hotel, and take care of basic travel needs in the city and food accommodations. While coming back from vacation, during Check-In at Dhaka, Saudi Airlines informed me that I would need to pick up all my luggages from Riyadh for my one day stay and take it all to the hotel and bring it back the next day for my connecting flight. I was carrying nearly nine 50-pound luggages and three 15-pound luggages, so this was unacceptable, but the airlines once again informed me that it was their policy. When boarding for my flight from Riyadh to New York after Check-In, a man approached me and asked for my passport. He didn't ask any other passenger for their passport, but asked me, which I felt very disrespected by and saw as an act of discrimination as me and my family members were the only visibly different looking ones boarding the plane dressed in our cultural clothing. I already presented my passport at Check-In and even received my boarding pass, so there was no reason for this Saudi Airlines representative to check my passport again and that being he was checking no one else's passport. On a positive note, the on-board crew for the flights were great and the food was decent. All in all, I will not fly with Saudi Arabian Airlines again after this traumatic experience and hope that the airlines could even offer any form of apology or compensation for all that I have been through.","September 5, 2017",1,Date of travel: August 2017,,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1

I have been taking several middle eastern airlines in the past and am used to good service and state of the art planes there. Well, Saudia seems to be the exception to the rule. The plane seems to be extremely old with uncomfortable seats. But the worse thing was the following. In this 10 hours flight, for some reason, several of the inflight entertainment screens were not working. Not even the reading light could be turned on. That meant that I could neither watch a movie, listen to music or even read my book as it was a night flight. The crew, when asked for clarification of the problem or a change of seat, could not care less and was extremely unhelpful. I even talked to the supervisor and he was rude and did not offer any solution. I asked for another seat but he said economy was full. so I asked for premium but he said it was also full. Later on I found out that this was a lie. I told him, as I have a stop over in Jeddah, at least I want to have access to the lounge. Mohammed (that was his name) said that he has arranged it and I would just have to go there and they will let me in. Also a lie, the staff there was even more unhelpful and extremely rude. I also found out from another traveler that the same thing happened to him already twice before with Saudia on the same route. Although my second leg flight from Jeddah to Madrid was a bit better with a better plane, this was the very last time I took Saudia and I would not recommend it to anyone, considering the many other options there are on the same route.","August 29, 2017",2,Date of travel: August 2017,"Berlin, Germany",2,1,2,4,4,1,3,2

1662,saudia_airlines,First time...and many more to come 👍,"I don't usually fly Saudia...no specific reason...it just was never on my radar!I found and excellent rate flying amman-toronto-amman this summer so i decided to give it a shot with my family. Amman-jeddah flight was ok. 2 hrs long so not much to brag about. As for the jeddah-toronto flight, i must say i was very positively surprised. I was expecting an average flight. It was anything but that...Staff were super friendly and helpful (especially coming back from Toronto with 1 month old twins). Waleed especially (at pearson) was super attentive to every detail to make sure everything went well. Food variety and quality were excellent. No complaints about service. On board entertainment was more than satisfactory. The full flat seats were 👍👍👍 (dreamliner 787)Layover duration for my flight was perfect. Around 3 hours for both my flight itineraries. I would def fly again and would recommend it to anyone reading this review based on my experience. Just a couple of points to point out:-were told that our car seats and strollers would be released in jeddah but unfortunately that did not happen. Hope they can fox that in the future. This is critical for anyone with kids-jeddah airport is not ur best place for a transit. I was told the new ""amazing"" airport should be operational within. Month or two. That should be cooool!-for those who do not know. Saudia does not serve alcohol. Perfectly ok with me. But, if it's a decisive factor for u then u might wanna a different airline ;)))Overall, experience was exceptional. No surprise that Saudia was awarded as the most improved airline of the year).

It is obvious that they never get cleaned, and in all probability have never been cleaned since the aeroplanes were purchased off the manufacturer.  The windows on their aeroplanes are filthy, and the view through them can only be compared to that seen through thick fog. Unfortunately this detracts from the quality of the journey experienced by the passenger. It also shows a lack of concern about the quality of journey offered to their customers.  In order to maintain the standard of cleanliness of the windows, I recommend that they are cleaned at least every two weeks. They shouldn’t blame the problem on the climate in Saudi Arabia. I have travelled in and out of Saudi Arabia on other airlines and the windows on their aeroplanes have been spotless.

Their flights usually are. The food was perhaps not overwhelming, but decent. The seats are wide and comfortable (no full recline, but this is a daylight flight, so it does not really matter), worse than BA, but, for a daylight flight, better than the new LH business seats, which seem much narrower, at least for my size (ca 6'4""). The choice of films and other media on offer seemed sufficient, but I usually read on flights. I did not use WiFi. They should check the seats more often, though. The neck rest did not hold in place. On other flights, the monitor was broken.

Sure the plane was almost new, clean and comfortable but just pray they don't lose your bag. I arrived in Heathrow, my bag didn't. In spite of giving all my details to a very helpful staff member and pointing out that I was only going to be in the UK for 3 days before going on to Europe for a cruise, my bag never caught up with me. In fact it arrived back in Sydney before I did.Yes I could log onto the global lost baggage site to find out that my case was ""being dealt with"" but I found it impossible to contact the airline by email. UK phone numbers all switched through to a message service, completely unhelpful when cruising and having intermittent phone service. My return trip to Sydney (Cathay Pacific all the way thank goodness) did not arrive until late evening by which time the lost luggage office was closed. I had to make a separate 5 hour round trip back to the airport to collect the bag as it could not be delivered because Saudi do not fly into Sydney so couldn't be billed for costs.I guess the moral of the story is use airlines that fly in and out of Sydney.","August 9, 2017",2,Date of travel: June 2017,Curramore,4,1,5,3,4,2,1,3

1699,saudia_airlines,There's nothing called priority on it!,"I am very disappointed from my experience with Saudi Airlines and King abdul aziz Airport in jeddahLast week on the 25th of july was our flight from Istanbul to Khartoum with our transit in jeddah. Our tickets were business class tickets, and our baggages were marked as priority ones. Things were going okay until we arrived to khartoum. Despite waiting for more than half an hour until the baggages were delivered to the terminal, we kept standing waiting our baggages to show up for more than an hour, most baggages were delivered by the end of the belt, but ours were not, they were not loaded on the plane even from jeddah. We looked for someone responsible to talk with about our concern, fortunately a lady helped. We wrote a record to Saudi Airlines to report our missed baggages ( 5 different sized baggages, mostly expensive, with valuable items inside) and she informed us that our baggages will arrive in the next flight, and that they are to inform us when they arrive. We waited for the next flight that was scheduled to arrive after 10 hours. After 8 hours of flying time we had to stay overnight for 10 hours more without any piece of cloth to change. 10 hours later, we received no calls from the airport. We called the Saudi Airlines office in Khartoum to ask for help, and to ask about our baggages. What we received from that office was ""We can't help you, we can do nothing, contact the airport or someone else"". The airport's lady who first wrote the record and gave us a contact number, didn't answer our calls for over an hour. Later, she answered coldly that Saudi Airlines in Jeddah did not direct our baggage to Khartoum yet. We are now on the 2nd of August and nobody reached for us to deliver our baggages.

1700,saudia_airlines,Nightmare,"If anybody needs to fly Saudia - good night! I need to use this airline regularly as this is the only way to get around in this large country. Thos is a combined review after around 20-30 flights with this horrible airline.The security check at the airports is practically non-existent. Some is guy sitting in front of a x-ray screen but he is texting on his phone or chatting with the other uniformed people standing around. Boarding is a chaotic mess. The screens at the gate show the wrong flight and if I wouldn't speak Arabic I would probably never have found out what was going on. When boarding started all passengers were running towards the gate and tried to get through. On the plane, don't expect to sit in the seat assigned to you. Either some arrogant, ignorant Saudi is already sitting in your seat and you end up arguing or the flight attendants resort the passengers because of male-female separation issues. The service during the flight is practically non-existent. They serve coffee, tea, water and juice. If you're lucky (or unlucky) you'll get a dry sandwich or a muffin thrown at you by indifferent flight attendants. I can't even be angry with them as they constantly have to endure abusive behavior by the customers who often treat them like servants.Punctuality is less the acceptable which left me stranded several times in the last years because of missed connections.All together try to avoid Saudia or get ready for an adventure which might drive you mad!One more thing: If you think you could use their lounges if you are a SkyTeam Elite Plus member... dream on.

Nobody at the airport cares to offer a coupon for food/drinks ( Note that the options for food in Jeddah airport are not wide ) . And when I reached Riyadh , my bag was lost and I couldn't retrieve it until 1 week ! In short : Use Saudi airlines for the routes usually to Dubai or the near gulf destinations .Avoid using it in the peak seasons , avoid a layover in Jeddah airport or any airport in the kingdom . Go for Emirates / Etihad when travelling long distances","July 31, 2017",1,Date of travel: June 2017,Lebanon,2,3,4,1,2,1,3,1

Stuck in a small dark room, with very few facilities for six hours, although this might have been better than the next three hours waiting in the main airport lounge, in which there were again few facilities, but this time it was absolutely packed, barely any floor space there were so many people sat or laid on the floor. I thought salvation had arrived after nine hours waiting and my flight was called for boarding. Everyone was queuing at the appropriate gate, mainly Filipinos and some westerners, but boarding never started, other than the locals that kept getting let through. When the official was asked what was happening, he just shouted at everyone to, ""go away"" and ""the flight is delayed"" with no explanation! It then appeared as if his boss told him to start checking people in, to which he shouted no and walked off, by this time the flight was on final call for boarding. Eventually after our flight should have departed we were eventually boarded, with no explanation as to what the problem had been, or why there was a delay and certainly no apology.

1707,saudia_airlines,"Just ""Ok""","SAUDIA airlines receives many unfavorable reviews both online and in print. I recently flew business class for its comfort and amenities. The comfort was good but the amenities were lacking. First, the business/first class lounge at Jeddah airport is a joke. For those who don't already know Jeddah airport is usually rated the 1st or 2nd worst airport in the world. Rightly so. The lounge was dirty, as were the toilets and the plates for which they used to served very mediocre food. Luckily the food and service onboard my 10 hour flight was good. On my return from Manila lounge was only slightly better still an embarrassment for business and first class flyers. Once onboard the wifi was not working and the entertainment screen didn't work until 1 hour into my flight. Once again the service for business class was good but nothing special. The time however the food was at best ""fair"". The rolls were at least 1 day old and my tenderloin was anything but tender. The flight attendant saw me struggling to cut it and asked if it was tough - I said it was ok. Truth be told I've received better food on other airlines when I fly economy/coach. The service on my return flight was good. To the flight crew I will give an unsolicited piece of advice. When a flight attendant notices an empty coffee cup, ask the passenger if they would like a refill before you take it away. I would have liked to enjoyed an additional cup of coffee.","July 16, 2017",3,Date of travel: July 2017,United States,3,3,0,0,4,1,3,0

Jeddah more i have to admit... i'm not getting in the details, but never ever fly through Jeddah!!!

However, to watch a movie on the inflight entertainment system, you needed an app and you needed internet to download it. This meant if you were like me - unaware of how quirky the setup is or that an app is needed - you would have to pay to download the app (which I would have expected one could download for free, no?) or just settle for no entertainment and non-stop ads for a third of the way (many of which boast how great the services are in Saudi Arabian Airlines).The highlight of the trip was the co-pilot expressing how proud he was to fly us - the well-behaved passengers... LOL! I can only imagine what the not so well-behaved passengers did... Probably it was the lack of entertainment or the app you couldn't download without paying for internet.Anyhow, I'm happy to be a well-behaved passenger.In all fairness, this is the first time I've travelled on a Saudia flight internationally with no inflight entertainment...

1712,saudia_airlines,I wish I could rate it lower,I have flown business on Saudi airlines 6 times in the past year and every experience has been worse then the previous. This flight however has definitely sealed the deal for me to NEVER fly this airline again. The planes have been 'upgraded' from the 777-300 to the airbus A330 and it is pathetic. This plane seems to have been retired from a different route and is falling apart. The business class seats are now recliner seats as are found in most premium economy products on other airlines. Screens and seat adjustments are not functioning properly. The plane seems to have never been cleaned and there were crumbs and pieces of food left from the previous flights. The service was absolutely pathetic and many menu items were unable. It is ridiculous that Saudi airlines is now trying to pass off a premium economy product as business class.

1713,saudia_airlines,The worst.,"The most unfortunate happened when I was in Paris - my passport was stolen. Since my original flight was UK to Manila, I had to purchase a new ticket of Paris to Manila because the embassy said I wasn't allowed to go to another country without my passport anymore except to go home. I asked the embassy whether I can purchase this ticket because there are NO direct flights from Paris to Manila and they said yes. When I arrived at the airport check-in counter, however, Saudia refused to board me because they said ONE-WAY as indicated on my temporary passport means ONE PLANE RIDE only and since there was a stop-over at Saudi then it means I booked a TWO-WAY flight. I had to cancel this flight (with penalty) and I had to book from another airline (Turkish Air, which had no problems understanding what one-way means). The worst part was the staff were even sniggering and mocking me when I was trying to explain what one-way meant as opposed to a return ticket.","July 6, 2017",1,Date of travel: October 2016,"Quezon City, Philippines",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1714,saudia_airlines,A pity,"I recently flew with my family to Dubai from Jeddah on the 26th of June and returned on the 1st of July. I have used saudia quite a few times over the past 25 years as I live in Yanbu industrial city. On the domestic flights you don't notice much because it is a short flt. (Yanbu-Jeddah) though I did notice the interior of the plane was and is badly in need of repair. On this particular flight we flew Dubai on the triple 7. My seat's back was uncomfortable as the hard plastic was protruding out. I put a pillow and kept quiet. Service was below the standard,announcements were not understandable plus the cabin crew were all badly groomed and frankly not up to the standard in looks. The male supervisor or purser had his stomach protruding out. I used to work with Saudia from 1979 till 1986 so I know the standard. I expected it at least to be the same or at least higher. We used to do our utmost best to make our passengers feel comfortable and safe and that they wanted to fly saudia again. I got married and resigned in 1986 to start a family. We flew this time on saudia as the price was right. Sad to say I was so disappointed to see how the standard of the cabin crew, catering, cleanliness and ground service has been lowered. Some male and female cabin crew were overweight. At my time we had we had the grooming instructors coming on board for a surprise check. We even had the catering supervisors on to check the food. I would like to request that saudia bring themselves up to something standard again because I was proud at my time to say I was flying for saudia.Some suggestions if you don't mind1) Cleaner interiors 2) improve the look of the cabin attendants 3) upgrade the food 4) have small stickers for passengers to put on their headrests so as not to be awaken(on the return flight the hostess woke me up 3 times to ask whether I wanted breakfast,juice and coffee or tea.5) train the cabin attendants to make better announcementsI apologize for writing such a bad review but it is just that I feel bad to see the airline in such a bad shape comparing to my time.In fact I am not the only one who has noticed this a lo of people have. My married daughter who left for Dubai 3 days before us had also lots of grievances. It would be absolutely beneficial for all parties if the standard is upgraded to saudia 's glorious years especially when there is so much competition nowadays.

I live and work in Saudia so it helps to use the national flag carrier but every time I travel with Saudi I come across something unheard of or extraordinarily bizarre. This time another strange thing happened. The pilot announced at sunset that Muslims could break their fast but no one came to serve water or dates or the food. I guess the captain expected the people to step out of the flying plane to get/ buy their food. I did not expect this from a purely muslim airline. Luckily I had bought some Ajwa dates from the airport and I was not as negligent or ignorant to share them with fellow passengers. The food arrived finally an hour or so after the time to break fast.

This delay however would cause me (and 5 other passengers) to miss their connecting flights. Luckily they recognized this issue before take off, but it took 4 hours of standing around without any guidance to be offered an alternative. I cannot honestly say whether it was because of the determined business class passenger who was delayed with us or because of the airline itself but they made up for this issue threefold - they put us up in a very nice hotel for the night and arranged upgraded flights with another airline the very next day. I wasn't in a rush to get to my next destination so thoroughly enjoyed the delay, although I cannot say the same for the gentleman who took it upon himself to demand such treatment.

They had all the charm and spacious luxury of the old Eastern Shuttle or a Greyhound Bus, but they got the job done. Their international service was so miserable that I would fly anyone else even though it meant $3,000 more for a business class ticket. But the domestic competition and the painful contrast with Etihad, Qatar and other airlines in the region seems to have bestirred Saudia a bit: our pilot spoke to us, my ticket was significantly less expensive than in 2006, the plane had a lived in look but it was clean.

I told her that i'm not taking pictures of her but the cabin plane. She insisted that i should delete the picture because that's the law of Saudi Airlines. I didn't argued much but just deleted the picture and took a new one once she left.Later on , she served coffee and tea to everyone except me which i find it very unprofessional.The food was good but they don't provide a menu before serving the food. My table was broken so it was impossible for the plate to stand so i had the choose another seat, luckily the plane wasn't fully booked.The earphone was broken and noisy so i didn't watch any movie during my flight. During returning flight from Jeddah to Singapore, the security forgotten to check our passports, boarding pass and exit pass( necessary in Saudi). We were asked to leave the bus and go again to the hall for security check.Once we entered again to the bus and headed to the plane , the bus driver was asked to stop the bus in front of the plane for more than 30 minutes. None gave us any explanation or apologize.

1759,saudia_airlines,Inefficient Crews,"I was with my son and a friend in travelling to Paris with lay-over in Jeddah via this airline. We were surprised that the ground crew refused to issue our boarding passes with the main reason that we were entering the European Union in Paris when it was Germany that issued our Schengen Visa. She asked us copies of our train tickets to Germany before the said passes could be issued. She conferred with her co-workers who decided to get all our passports, claiming that they had to confer to Paris if we will be allowed entry. It took us an hour to wait for their action. During this period, we contacted our friend, a Dutch citizen who arranged all our train bookings to send us copies of our tickets. We were able to secure the copies but it still took them additional number of minutes to release our passports and the corresponding boarding passes. This was after we tried to look for their Manager since we already provided them the documents that they were requesting. An addition to the insult was the ground crew taking pictures of our passports and boarding passes, reasoning this time that they did not want to blamed for wrongly issuing our boarding passes. We felt belittled with their treatment and infringement of our personal documents.My disappointment with the airline's service was aggravated when one of our luggage was lost. The website wherein we could monitor the whereabouts of my luggage reflected wrong personal information, considering that I gave them everything in the airport upon filing of my claim-complaint. It took them four days to deliver the luggage after a number of follow-ups made by my Dutch friend. Moreover, the said luggage was delivered at the time when we hurrying up to catch our train to Germany. There was not even an apology note received from the said airline for the stresses that we all experienced.","May 20, 2017",2,Date of travel: April 2017,"Las Pinas, Philippines",3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1

I thought it was strange that they asked to see my baggage claim ticket prior to getting on the aircraft, but then when I landed my checked bags were no where to be seen (got it two days later and it was a nightmare) but I later found out it was no fault of Saudi. I walked on board the 777-300, we boarded behind first class but from a quick glance you can tell that they were pretty nice, business had the private cocoons and economy had 9 abreast seating which was a plus the aircraft was new with a large AVOD screen (much larger than Delta or Air France) seats were nice leather with a nice recline. They had a curtain offed prayer area where 12 middle seats are typically located. The flight attendants are from the Philippines since female Saudi's are not allowed to be flight attendants. A prayer was shown on TV prior to departure and we were off. Downside of the seats were that the armrest were not mobile so I could not really take advantage of the empty seat to the right of me. It was kinda funny that they blurred out women's legs and chest on all of the movies and of course no alcohol was on the flight. What I thought was really nice is that you received actual silverware for your meal.

1766,saudia_airlines,"Really good planes, surprisingly good food, amazing staff, but terrific transit in Jeddah","Booked a SIN/JED/CDG without high expectations (best price by far found on the Internet). The only issue was a 5hr layover in Jeddah airport. I'm not Gold with Skyteam meaning no perks.1. Planes are really good. 777 with personal screens. Electrical plugs available. Amazing staff, very nice (OMHO nicer than EK for instance). But no much frills: no snack between meals for instance, no alcohol served. Well with 2 meals a flight it's not so bad. Flights were half full.2. Connection in Jeddah is a mess. On top of the useless red tape, be prepared for some local rough touch, an overcrowded waiting area and uncoordinated process with little info.Bag screening is done in messy lines with plenty of local people not used to taking a plane apparently. Not as per international standards: they don't care about laptops, but you need to remove your shoes. Be prepared to lose sight of your carry on luggage for several minutes.ñVery limited duty fee. Only one lounge, which was completely packed (tried to pay to enter but it was too full)Then I had to find a seat. The south terminal is rather small with limited seating. Many people (mostly pilgrims) sitting on the floor. People everywhere . Only two food stalls with panini as at 8 EUR. No electric plug. No water fountain. Only one toilet which was not so clean and packed (even for males!). The free wifi isn't working (PIN by SMS which is never received). I could work with my computer fully charged in the plane and my headset with music (however people will look at your screen out of curiosity)After 4 hours they called the flight for CDG. Passed the ticket check gate, and then queued for the bus. Suddenly (bus half full) they said the plane would be delayed for one hour due to technical issue. No official announcement. Everybody back to the main terminal room. No information 'till the flight was announced again, 1.5 hr later. A few surprises along the way (they ask for the transit card which was taken at the first failed boarding attempt, they make people go down to the bus room while there is no bus, the bus stops in front of the plane with nobody to welcome it - clear lack of coordination- wonder how they are doing during Hajj time).Arrived In Paris with 2hr delay. Not so bad after all, especially at that price, if you can withstand the connection.However I couldn't help wondering what would have happened if the flight had been cancelled.

1777,saudia_airlines,"average plane, average service","It had been almost 10 years since I had flown with Saudis. The last time I flew with the airline it was on a Boeing 747 from South Asia to Jeddah. This time I was flying from Abu Dhabi to Jeddah, and I choose to fly Saudia because I wanted to try the product. In the decade since I had flown, Saudia had been on a push to modernize and update their fleet, so I wanted to experience the revised Saudis.Our flight from Abu Dhabi to Jeddah was scheduled to take off at 11:50a. After the reservations been booked, I tried to go online and manage the reservation but could not. I had booked the flight through a travel agent, but for other airlines this had never been a problem. I called the reservation number to manage my booking, including adding frequent flyer numbers, requesting special meals, and seat assignments. I had downloaded the Saudia app but even through that I could not manage my booking. The day before my flight I went online to checkin – online checkin is only available in some markets – and when checking in I could change seats and review my booking. Even though we had checked in, we were still told to be at the airport 3hrs early. We arrived to the airport two hours early and there was no one in line so checkin and luggage tagging was very quick. We received our printed boarding pass and went to spend some time before the flight.The flight was scheduled to take off at 11:50am and boarding scheduled to start at 10:40am, but when we arrive at the gate around 10:30a the inbound aircraft had not arrived yet. The aircraft arrived around 11am and it took a while before the plane was ready to be boarded which resulted to a delayed start. The operating aircraft is an Airbus A321in a 3-3 layout. The boarding process started and we boarded the plane. The first three rows were in 2-2 business class layout followed by economy class. When I checked in, I was able to select seats in front of the plane. While the outside of the plane looked decent, the inside of the plane indicated it was an older plane. There are positive and negative aspects of older planes – the positive being bigger seat width and seat pitch while the negative include less amenities such as USB ports and PTVs. As this was an older plane, the seats were large and comfortable with a good seat pitch. There were no USB port nor any PTVs, the only feature of the seat was channel and volume control in the side of the armrest (some of which worked, some didn’t). The passengers boarded and we deplaned behind schedule – as in before Saudia never seemed to be focused on ontime departure. As soon as all passengers had boarded, refreshing wipes were passed out. A safety video was screened on the overhead screens (some of which came down, others didn’t).The scheduled flight time is 3hr10min but the actual flight time is around 2.5hrs. We reached cruising altitude, but even after that the flight attendants took another 30-45mins before the service started. They first started by delivering the special meals, but it took them another 20-30mins before the regular service started. The service included a meal and drink service. The meal included a choice between chicken and fish with rice. The meals were substantial in amount but were average in taste. After the meal both tea and coffee were offered.Once the meal trays were cleared, there was really nothing to do to pass the time. The entertainment on board including the airline magazine as well as some programs shown on the overhead screen. The shows included lots of commercial and only 10mins of Mr.Bean; however it was difficult to hear thru program as the channel system stopped working many times. After a bit more time, we descended into Jeddah. We landed and taxied to our parking spot – Jeddah does not have any jetbridges so every passengers deplaned via stairs and buses. Overall, it was an average flight with Saudia. I had not seen any changes in the last ten years, as both then and now both the aircraft and service were decent; nothing spectacular and everything right above basic. From others who have taken the Boeing 777, those planes have good seat pitches, USB ports and PTVs so I am a bit torn as whether to take Saudia longhaul – they have good specials and prices but their service can be average.","April 15, 2017",3,Date of travel: April 2017,"Kenner, Louisiana",4,2,3,3,4,2,3,3

I had a tv I wanted to take to Lahore and took it with me to Heathrow, I asked them if it was okay to check in and they told me it was fine so I checked it with the rest of my luggage. When the time came for me to fly from Jeddah to Lahore the Saudi airline check in staff refused to check in the tv. I calmly explained to them Saudi airlines in Heathrow checked in the tv so why was it a problem here. I was made to wait over half an hour after which I was told that it would have to be sent cargo, as I had small children with me I did not want to argue and agreed to pay whatever price. At this point however I was met with absolutely zero empathy and understanding, the porter saw my plight and kindly guided me to the cargo area, which was a 50 ryal taxi trip away, eventually I paid 350 ryal to Saudi cargo and got my tv sent. Despite checking in early we were not given a baby bassinet, even though there were hardly any babies on the flight.The money was not a problem but the awful treatment and inconsistency from Saudi Airlines was shocking, if I hadn't reached airport 5 hours early I would probably have given the TV away at the airport to save the hassle. The flight itself was pleasant enough and can not fault the cabin crew, however the check in staff at Jeddah really need to up their game.","February 19, 2017",1,Date of travel: February 2017,,3,1,4,3,3,3,1,1

1811,saudia_airlines,Very good airline :) great quality/price ratio,"I knew Saudia was part of Skyteam, so when I saw this MXP-KUL-SIN-MXP flight at an incredibly low price I instantly booked. Then, as the departure date approached, I gave a look to the reviews and I got quite alarmed from the amount of negative ones. Now, after 4 flights and some 20,000 kms with Saudia, I decided to spend a few minutes to write a review, which I don't usually do, but I feel the company fully deserves it:-Booking: quick and easy, no problem whatsoever.-Aircrafts: A320 for the ""short"" flight, Boeing 777ER for the long leg. Both new, clean, in perfect conditions. True, the A320 didn't have the personal screen but there is a wifi service with a great selection of movies, games, flight info etc.-Cabin crew: nice, efficient and smiling.-Food: very good, way better than most European companies and definitely than all American ones.-Cleanliness: aircrafts were perfectly clean, unfortunately there's people that don't know how to use a bathroom! Crew was even entering the toilets from time to time to flush and to spray some perfume.-Flight punctuality: just perfect, we even landed 15 mins ahead of schedule in MXP.-Leg room: unless you're a NBA player you'll have plenty.All in all, I found Saudia WAY better than any American company I've flown with, and easily at the level of the various BA/AF/KLM & co... at half the price, though! The only problem can be the layover in Jeddah, more than 2-3 hours in that place can be very taxing. Apparently, a new airport is bound to open but it's unclear when. However, this isn't Saudia's fault.

1833,saudia_airlines,Will think twice before choosing this airline,"The experience was bad from start, poor boarding practices, i had my parents on wheel chair, they were allowed to boar first but no one else, so there is no on the plane to assist them.Arrival to Jeddah, No wheel chair provided at all they had to walk and take stairs to de-board from plain. we were total of 7 in the group with 2 pieces per-person allowance we had a total of 14 pieces of luggage, guess what 10 pieces were missing , including the bag which we were going to use during our stay in Saudi. and it took hour+ to file report using computer by the incompetent staff. he had to re-start multiple time the report. also their system to check the status of the bags doesn't work, no one answers the phone, on 4th day we decided to visit the airport and the bags were there.Now after our stay in Saudi we had to continue to next destination ""Lahore"" we reported 3 hrs before departure time as recommended for international flights, we were in queue for long time, and they were letting people bypass the line. and again no wheelchairs.","January 5, 2017",1,Date of travel: December 2016,"Seattle, Washington",3,2,3,2,3,3,3,1

Over 18 years living in the Kingdom, each time there is an airport renovation I hope that the outcome would be passenger centered.This time you got it right Saudi with opening of terminal 5 in Riyadh. I have been checked in twice by the most delightful and passenger friendly ground service agent Mr Thamer Alanizi whose smile is like morning sunshine! Quick, efficient and extremely pleasant! The Al Fursan lounge is brilliantly appointed with tasteful modern interior design with understated elegance, clean lines, brilliant lighting and functional. There's a balance between group seating and private seating that is just right! It includes a mosque with ablution facilities that are clean and user friendly. Sadly, the same cannot be said for Jeddah. However, I remain hopeful that with the renovation activities it also will produce the level of guest services in Riyadh.

1836,saudia_airlines,MUST READ - LUGGAGE/LOCATION/SERVICE,"LUGGAGE: Firstly my flight was a flight to Jeddah and then Dhaka from London. I will start with the worst thing and then move on to the best and then continue to explain my 4 flights. On the flight form Jeddah to Dhaka half of the passengers had lost at least one piece of luggage, my family lost 6 out of 8, this meant we had to wait 3 hours at the airport only to be told that we were waiting for nothing as our luggage was still in KSA. We do not live in Dhaka, we live 6 hours away, as they did not know when our luggage would come we had to take that journey without our luggage. Then a day later they phone us and tell us that our luggage is here so my dad had to travel back to Dhaka to collect it and bring it back. They did not provide any sort of compensation or apology.LOCATION: When flying with Saudia your experience depends on where you are flying from and to, my flight from LHR to JDH was decent, normal seats and entertainment.9 inch 720p screen with a remote. The movies etc were not that good as there is not much choice. the service was good, they had 3 meal options, chicken, beef and fish. The food was good. my next flight was from JDH to DAC and it was terrible. They had 9 inch 480p screens, alot of them didn't even work. They only had two meal options fish and chicken. The food was bad. Some of the seats did not recline too. The service was bad they did not care. The flight from DAC to Riyadh was similar but a bit better. The airline also provided a small meal whilst waiting for the connection flight. Riyadh to LHR was amazing. The screens were huge, 11 inch i think, 1080p, amazing service and amazing food. 3 meal options, chicken, fish and beef. They also served snacks later on in the flight which was sandwhiches a chocolate bar and some fruit. They also added moodlighting to this flight. Overall Saudia is not really a balanced airline, i would not fly with them again, i would rethink if most of their flights were like the last i flew.","January 2, 2017",3,Date of travel: December 2016,,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3

I was very upset when I arrived to see that my brand new duffel bag hadn't made it.  I was given no kind of compensation whatsoever at the airport and had to walk out bag less...no toiletries, no daily allowance...NOTHING!!! I was in a precarious situation as I was leaving Johannesburg the next day on an overland camping tour. I absolutely needed the sleeping bag and warm clothes that had failed to arrive in Johannesburg. It is winter and nights are cold. No torch, knife, scarf, hat etc... The three numbers I was given were called me repeatedly with no success for two days. No one there to answer?? I got the bag three days late and well into my safari trip with no camera to take photos with. It was tricky to have the bag delivered. I had to leave 700 rand from my pocket at reception to pay the taxi driver who delivered the bag from Kruger airport whilst I went out on a fourth day without the bag.  I was distraught to see that my brand new duffel bag was very dirty and ripped in places. It was a bag I had purchased especially for the trip as it fits in the lockers in the truck perfectly. My headlamp, which was in the outside pocket, is broken and doesn't work anymore. When I arrived at the first internet stop on the overland trip I sent a mail explaining the problem. I have now been back and forth through many different services in Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Paris, Geneva. People have promised me that I’ll be called back and then nothing. Ms Smith, who initially replied, has vanished off the face of the earth??I sent a letter (registered mail) to Jeddah and they've not even picked it up??? Or the address on their site is a fake. I went back to Geneva airport and spoke to one of their agents about it. He gave me another mail to use. I did. I got a response to say that my complaint had been registered. That was weeks ago. I'm now reduced to sending them a mail a day hoping that they will some day wake up.  I'm obviously very disappointed with the after sales service which I find shocking. If they don't contact me soon I will be obliged to take legal action as they are not getting away with this!!!Worst airline I've ever been through. DON'T FLY WITH THEM. THEY'RE DISHONEST.

The seat buttons work intermittently and once the seat position is brought into a sleep setting it is impossible to bring it back up. The flight was empty with only 9 of the 22 seats taken however my menu choice was still not available!!!Soft drinks are not offered as part of the meal service but rather on request and I received my drink after asking 6 times!!!The return flight was not much better. I made sure to select a different seat to avoid any issues however seat 1L also had similar problems. I wasn't the only one complaining!! I counted 4 of the 22 seats malfunctioning. And let me not getting started on how filthy the interior is---I had to make a point of wiping down my entire area as I felt dirty every time I touched anything. Complaints go unanswered and you are simply ignored. Meal service once again and lo and behold my menu choice was once again unavailable!! I mean do they actually understand the concept of business class?? It is so unfortunate that we have to put up with this horrific service and even more horrendous product quality because this is the only direct flight to the holy lands and choosing almost any other airline will result in more then double the travel time.

For the entrees, they were out of three out of four selections and all that was left was a lamb and rice dish which was less than satisfactory. The inflight entertainment was less than desirable. All the movie was heavily edited with terrible dubbed lines and the women were blurred out from the neck up, which I totally understand. I will say that the attendants were very friendly. I did like the offering of Arabian coffee and dates. That was very cool. I ended up sleeping most of the flight.

I can't say too much bad about the flight, as no flight in enjoyable. The first class area of the plane was lovely and had so much space, but nothing out of the ordinary.

1892,saudia_airlines,"Airline fine for price, Jeddah airport a disaster","I searched a lot to find a proper review of Saudi Airline but I couldn't find one, so I hope you find this helpful. I booked my flight from Johannesburg to Paris via Jeddah with Saudi Airlines. The price was great, much cheaper than their competitors. I found the flights to be fine. The aircraft used between Johannesburg and Jeddah is a Boeing 777, which is slightly older, but fine. From Jeddah to Paris, it's a Boeing Dreamliner which is quite new and comfortable. Overall the planes were relatively clean as well. The in-flight service is not good. It's a dry flight, so no alcohol, which is fine, but they are also quite stingy with water/cold drinks - you need to constantly ask. The food was also ok, nothing special. There was also only one meal per flight and then a snack, which basically consist of dry bread with cheese and a cake-type thing. Not great. Compared to other airlines, their in-flight service needs improvement. The air hostesses leave room for improvement as well. By far my worst experience while traveling with Saudi is the Jeddah Airport. I had a 7:50 hour layover going to Paris and a 6:30 back to Johannesburg in the South terminal. The airport is by far the worst I have ever seen. The duty-free shopping area is non-existent. There are only 3 'shops' of which only one looks like you can buy something at. They do take USD, after some convincing. The entire terminal is about 200 square meters, so it's very small. The toilets are disgusting, it's constantly wet and I didn't want to touch anything. The staff are rude and very 'superior'. I could wait to get on my flight out of there. The entire terminal is also a non-smoking area. So smoking is not an option at all. There is one lounge at the terminal, but it's exclusively for business and first class passengers. No Priority Pass access. From what I gather, they are busy building a new airport, but it's still a far way from finished. Overall, if it wasn't for the horrible layover, I would recommend Saudi ONLY if the price is fantastic. But if I have to book again, I would pay the few extra Rands to either fly direct and via another layover destination.","October 2, 2016",3,Date of travel: September 2016,"Sea Point, South Africa",4,1,0,0,4,3,5,0

There were times where they would actually deny passengers even the most basic need such as water during a flight for reasons that is beyond me. In terms of their facilities and food, however, a lot has changed. Their in flight entertainment and in flight food has improved a lot. For me, their food is a lot better than the ones served in the other airlines I've flown with the exception of Singapore Airlines and Egypt Air.

There is no zest or very minimal interaction with the passengers. We have a very rough and hard landing in Manila. The pilot or the lead flight attendant should at least apologize but they did not.

1899,saudia_airlines,Maybe the worst customer service in the world....,"We booked our flights in March. The outbound flight to Jeddah was fine as Saudia usually are. For the return leg, we tried to check in the night before but it seemed the flight was cancelled. We tried calling customer services but no answer at night. Next morning we tried again and worked out that they had cancelled the flight 4 months previously but had not notified us - normally they send an SMS or e-mail so instead of rebooking the entire flight they left our flight from Riyadh to Jeddah and rebooked Muscat to Riyadh for the following day which doesn't work. Eventually located the Saudia office in Ruwi, Muscat who refused to help, had numerous calls to Saudia customer services who promised rebookings, confirmation e mails and call backs that never happened. We were then told to go to the airport as we could not travel but had left our hotel. Customer services said they would help us with a hotel, taxis, meals etc but the office at the airport was closed and when we located the rep eventually by phone, he came to the office and told us he couldn't help either. By then I had managed to rebook the flight for the following day. We had to find a hotel, pay for it, taxis and meals and take another day vacation. When we got to check in the following day we asked for our bags to be sent to Jeddah and were told they would be. When we got to Jeddah the bags were left in Riyadh and we were told we would have to come back and collect them from Jeddah Airport, at which point I lost the plot with the Supervisor and eventually he agreed to send the bags to us, and I received the only apology I had throughout the entire sorry debacle. We are still waiting for the bags and will try to claim some money back in the next day or so, but don't hold out much hope. Truly awful !!To be fair, it is often not the best flight experience but it has never been so bad before.

The stewardesses on the first flight were not very friendly or pleasant, but on the second leg, they could not have been nicer. Was interesting how very different they were.

I had taken out some money to buy water, and when I went through the security, they took it all away from me. Not impressed.Landing in London, I noticed we had some VIP Saudi Prince on board - he was taken down the back way to a car waiting, and I suspect this was why the security had been upgraded and the delay - not the first time this has happened when I have landed in the Arab states!!This is a dry Airline, and you cannot carry alcohol if you buy it at the airport.

1932,saudia_airlines,Worst airline I've ever used!,"To start with at Rome airport the staff at the check in desk were useless. I asked how long the flight was and the lady said ""I don't know"". We then boarded the flight at around 3 (flight due to take off at 3:40) we sat on the tarmac until 5:25 before the plane took off because apparently they were missing documents to fly. We sat for well over an hour before the flight attendants had any information on the cause of the delay or water in fact they just sat at the back of the plane having a chat. I also had to sit with my luggage at my feet because the staff allowed other passengers to take such big bags as hand luggage that all the overhead luggage cabins were full. We then landed in Riyadh to find out second flight to Male (Maldives) was also delayed. Once on this flight we found the airplane was disgusting there was chewing gum stuck to the walls. The padding of the chairs was falling off. The flight attendants on this flight also seemed fed up. My husband and I were sat on different rows with no one either side of us and neither of our entertainment systems worked on our seats or the seats next to us. Now, Saudi airlines is clearly a budget airline so the above wouldn't normally trouble me as I understand that you get what you pay for. However what has really upset me enough to write this review is that Saudi airlines lost our luggage. Again I understand that this happens in aviation but it's now been a day and a half since our bags were lost and Saudi still haven't located them. Meaning we're on a rather expensive honeymoon in the Maldives with no clean clothes, toiletries or books. I don't think that is it acceptable to make mistakes and then not even attempt to correct them. Our honeymoon is being ruined due to a lack of caring on this airlines behalf.","September 1, 2016",1,Date of travel: August 2016,,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,0

One thing I would like to be changed would be cabin atmosphere. Sometimes it gets a little noisy, which can worsen the atmosphere for a lot of passengers.

1943,saudia_airlines,Saudia from Singapore to Cairo via Jeddah,"The alarm goes, 09.30am, much earlier than I was used to the last few weeks, I get up, have breakfast, clean the last few dishes and make sure all is clean, then one last shower and prepare the last things in the bagage and handbagage. After some last photos of Kim in our apartment the agents arrive to check the inventory and take back the keys, they are really looking for something to charge us so they do not have to give us the deposit back but due to our good cleaning and our sweet but firm talk they can not find anything so we received our cheque for the return of the deposit.Ok, now that part 1 is over we bring our bagage downstairs, OMG we have way to many things ... we have a bagage allowance of 4 x 23 kg but even that is not enough to take everything with us. Well we only had to leave behind a few unimportant things so that's OK. So now I have booked a taxi we just have to wait for it to arrive, a few minutes later a brand new taxi arrives and by some miracle we manage to get everything inside, now the drive to Changi Airport Terminal 3 (photo 3).Upon arrival we ask where we can wrap our bagage as we have a lot of things in normal cardboard boxes with my iMac as extra, this apparently is only in Terminal 1 so we have to take the skytrain, once there I first weigh all things again to be sure and after a few modifications we have our extra boxes wrapped together (another 30 SGD), then we go back to Terminal 3 and head to check-in. All is well and we receive our boarding passes, by now both of us are a bit hungry so we sit down first to eat the cold pasta I prepared and drink a bit.Now we proceed to the customs area where they ask us to check the cat in, after some explaining they finally understand that Nessie is coming with us in the cabin and they say OK like all Singaporeans do when they see something that is not in their daily routine. Then I expected that the officer at the passport check would ask us for all those documents I had to prepare for the cat (more than 250 SGD of paperwork) but to my surprise they did not even bother, it makes me wonder why exactly I had to pay 50 SGD to AVA for an Export License ...?Now we are inside the Terminal on our way to gate A13 and when we arrive there the lady from check-in comes to ask us to pay the deposit for the cat, 407 SGD sir, I almost freaked out !!! The airline website clearly stated 130 USD which would be around 170 SGD, this is unacceptable as the airline had already confirmed it by email, after some complaining and explaining they agree that I pay the 130 USD and right after this we get on the airplane.Now we are settling in to our seat, they were nice enough to give us an empty seat so we had plenty of room for Nessie. We were finally leaving on a Boeing 777-200 of Saudia a bit later than planned and I was surprised that so many seats were empty, after a drink and a nice meal (chicken and vegetables with mashed potatoes) I got a small tea and although the entertainment system was not completely working in English started to select a movie, Kim was already falling asleep when a crewmember suggested that she could use the completely empty row next to us to lie down for a good rest, so far the service is excellent on Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia).I am just thinking about our next adventure after 14 months in Singapore, I look forward to Egypt but I am also going to miss Singapore a bit, it was not perfect but it felt like home now and I liked my free time in our neighborhood, truth is I also miss Belgium off course but both Kim and me are real adventurers so we will visit Belgium probably this year but I do not think we will move back there soon, if we ever do. During the first 5 hours of the flight Kim slept most of the time on the middle row while I stayed with Nessie and watched some movies, then when she woke up we switched so I could get some rest. After a few hours rest we had a nice breakfast and an hour later we arrived at Jeddah airport where we noticed immediately the difference in culture, already on the flight we were not allowed to wear shorts or uncovered shoulders and at this airport we felt a bit strange, almost no westerners in sight, we went to the transfer desk and after the security checkpoint we went to the gate area to wait for our next flight. This gate area looks old and there are no jetways, it was also very crowded so we couldn't find a quiet spot to relax a bit. Very uncomfortable but the Arab people don't seem to mind for some reason, I recognized the same way of waiting from my years at Brussels Airport as a security officer.After more than an hour we could finally board the bus to our next flight on a Saudia Boeing 747-400 with the same unorganized mess for boarding as we saw in the terminal, this time we did not have the seats for ourselves as this flight was really crowded, luckily it was only about an hour to Cairo.We left Jeddah with a small delay and as we were setting in for this short but crowded flight I noticed this was an older airplane as the entertainment system was not nearly as good as we had on the previous flight, this was an old generation system with seat remote and no movies unless you use a credit card, probably the reason why they place such a long distance airliner on such a short flight, it could also be because these flights are very popular.Once we were firmly in the air we got a nice warm meal again, a nice change from the European short flights I was used to where you don't get anything anymore, at the same time it also makes the time pass a bit easier. So far we still did not have to show any single document for Nessie so I guess they will ask for them in Egypt upon arrival.OK so by 01.30am we arrived at Cairo and after some custom checks we went to the exit only to be surprised that now we finally arrived and not a single check on Nessie had been done, they were more concerned with my computer than a cat! At the exit my colleagues were waiting for me and they took us to our apartment in New Cairo for a good sleep which we urgently needed, all of us!","August 19, 2016",4,Date of travel: September 2015,"Zonhoven, Belgium",5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4

After announcing the cancellation we were told a transfer would be organised to a hotel for the night. From then on it was a nightmare. No one to give any directions, no communication concerning the rescheduling. After calling every saudi airline number available for 4 hours, they finally called us to the airport for a flight which we ended up not boarding due to an issue with their booking software. After much complaining they booked us on a Qatar airline flights. The promised night at a hotel or lounge access in Doha were lies.

1951,saudia_airlines,HORIBBLE experience on business class with family,"We chose to travel with Saudi Airlines after a long time after some deliberation and having been given some mixed reviews from friends and family who had travelled recently. However, we afforded the airline the benefit of the doubt and decided to travel directly for Umrah via Saudi Airlines, under the impression that we would have a wonderful experience. After all, Business Class is supposed to be smooth and seamless so how bad could it possibly get? Little did we know what Saudi Airlines had planned for us. In the past, as a family we tend to travel with Emirates Business Class most of the time and their facilities, service and personnel have been exceptional. Our flight from Manchester to Medina, via Jeddah was one of the most horrible experiences we have faced. Not only was it humiliating, it was personally the worst flight and travel experience we have ever had. And we have travelled with Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar countless times.The staff that received us in the aeroplane were the most unworthy and untrained personnel we have ever encountered. Not a single one of them afforded a smile to any of us, nor attend to our requests. As paying customers, on expensive business class tickets, what is expectation?Everything from the service of the senior 'staff' on the plane, to the abrupt attitude of the lounge staff in the business class lounge in Jeddah; to the woman at immigration who pushed over my mother from her wheelchair and used obscene language; to the food on flight which gave me food poisoning from the uncooked slab of cold chicken. I receieved food poisoning from the food on flight and was sick for 3 days constantly after that. When I asked for help at the airport or medical attention, they made me queue first past immigration for 2 hours, and even then they didnt help even though they could see how sick I was. Not to forget 2 pieces of our luggage went missing and turned up 2 days later. The in flight entertainment in 'business class' only worked on some screens and the staff could really not be bothered helping. You ask for help, they go away and don't return and then you see them having a laugh elsewhere. There was lack of food on business class so we were forced to eat a set menu from a menu where we should have been able to choose options. Requested a blanket for my 2 year old son which arrived after an hour. Requesting water on flight was very difficult for the staff to obtain; 15 minutes it took them to bring water along. The staff in the lounge where we stopped for 6 hours in Jeddah were rude and disrespectful They didn't have any blankets available and the AC was on full blast. There are so many relevant points we can mention but the worst part is that having sent Saudi Airlines customer services feedback and complaints on our travel and experience, on 3 different emails and countless occasions, the only response we have had back is a generic response saying that they are looking into the matter. Basically their way of saying that we just don't care and fobbing us off with a fake apology.This is not about an airline striving for perfection or myself and family wanting everything perfect, this is based on the service and staff who were inadequate rude and arrogant. Mistakes could have been avloided and even then measures taken to make it better. But Saudi Airlines themselves as a company have failed to respond and help through customer services.

1954,saudia_airlines,Short flight took long time,"I opted to visit Madinah for a quick visit to Prophet's mosque before the Haj (pilgrimage) traffic starts. So, I decided to fly instead of driving all the way and back. The flight time is hardly 50-55 minutes.When I travel on domestic routes I always prefer to fly by Saudia as I am a big fan of their punctuality and it is much better than other local airlines. However, this time the experience was a little different. We all boarded the plane and the doors were closed on time, the plane went to the runway and kept standing there for like 5-7 minutes and returned back to its parking place and pilot informed us that due to some TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY we cannot fly and we have to wait until that DIFFICULTY gets fixed. It took about an hour or 75 minutes to get that difficulty fixed and then we moved on to our destination. Good thing was that we reached in time and I could easily perform all the rituals. On my way back, the flight was late once again for about an hour and this time the reason was that flight came late from Jeddah. Since it was my weekend trip to Madinah and I had no professional commitments to fulfil, so it was ok for me to be late for an hour or so. Sometimes, you have to reach some place in time and that actually matters a lot. I would still prefer to fly by Saudia as I understand that sometimes such delays happen.","August 9, 2016",3,Date of travel: August 2016,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",3,3,2,4,4,1,4,5

Air hostess don't really care much if you ring the bell to call them for anything. They should deal with care if specially anyone travelling with family. It was very difficult for us to get some water to drink after asking so many times they provided.The benefit of using Saudi Airlines if you are going on Umrah is that they give you baggage allowance of 2 x 23kg that is 46kgs in total for each passenger which is good enoughIn my opinion there should be more legroom because which travelling back to Karachi we had 1 stop at Riyadh which increased the travel time and we realized that my mom specially was not feeling comfortable with the available legroom as she get tired and need to sleep.Overall it was good.,"August 9, 2016",4,Date of travel: May 2016,"Karachi, Pakistan",4,1,4,4,4,3,3,3

I always fly business class and have the choice of a hot breakfast foul or omelette. Now they are only offering cold service which consisted of 1/2 a boiled egg and cheese. When I asked the flight attendant for salt she just smiled helpless and said this is the new meal offering. No condiments included.

On the latter point they allow people with the most outrageously oversized bags as hand luggage, so get on a flight early even to get small bags on the plane. Flights are broadly on time within KSA as the airports do not have many flights and Saudia flights seem to have preference.

Since my journey is for more than 8 hours, during this long haul food is my thing. I always look forward trying their in-flight food. Experienced with other airlines, after take off they offer some snacks and beverages only prior to landing they provide you with a full meal. But with SAUDIA, they'll provide you with 2 full meals. And same with all airlines, it is best if you manage your food selection it prior to your departure.","August 5, 2016",4,Date of travel: April 2016,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",3,4,3,4,4,3,4,3

Also the spacing between seats on domestic flights is too narrow while it is much better on international flights, you can feel the difference. I like the fact that they don't offer Alchool on their flights as this issue is normally causing problems on some other airlines when people get drunk. Their pilots are very professional and take off and landing is always very smooth.

1981,saudia_airlines,Good planes and flights but lax security,"The planes, crew and comfort on board are generally good. Take off times are often delayed due to passengers wanting to move seats. My main concern is lack of security on board with passengers using mobile phones during take off and landing/ babies not being safely strapped in for take off and landing, and on some flights passengers are still in the prayer room during the initial part of take off. Also,liquids of over 100ml are allowed through security checks.

1988,saudia_airlines,"Now average, considering their history","I've flown with Saudia many times since I was little kid growing up in Saudi Arabia. I traveled to my hometown of Karachi (Pakistan) at least once a year for holidays during my school years. I've witnessed their level of service deteriorate to a point where the ground staff and even the flight attendants didn't care at all about the comfort and convenience of passengers. Even basic services like getting boarding passes, getting through customs, and asking for a glass of water (in-flight) was such an unpleasant experience.It still is that way, although not as bad as it had become. The Saudia ground staff in other countries is not so bad really but the ones in Saudi airports treat passengers like animals, sometimes even telling them to ""shut up"" or saying stuff like ""don't talk to me"" while we're in the tunnel to board the plane. They forcibly take your carry-on luggage away to be loaded as checked baggage (I mean, what's the point of the allowance of one piece of carry-on luggage if it's going to be taken away right before you board the plane?). They tell you to take out any essential items that you might need during the flight and carry them in your hands (no bags are provided, not even cheap polythene bags). The flight crew behaves a little better these days, probably due to awareness on social media.My last flight with Saudia was in January 2016 and I only chose them because it was the only direct flight to Karachi and I was traveling with an infant. Otherwise, I don't mind going with other, much better airlines even though they are one-stop flights. The ground staff was bad as usual in Dammam but much better, and even polite, for the return flight from Karachi. The flight crew was good, the food was alright, the seats were comfortable, and we were given the front seats that are usually reserved for passengers traveling with infants. But they didn't have the special seat, nor a safety belt for infants on either of the two flights.With other, vastly better flying options available that are not only millions of miles ahead of Saudia but are also constantly improving in order to stay ahead of competitors, I neither prefer, nor recommend traveling with Saudia.","August 3, 2016",3,Date of travel: January 2016,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",3,1,3,3,3,2,2,1

Entertainment system was also very good, lots of choices and kept me entertained. The best thing about this flight was the service from the air hostess and hostesses. I have flown with many airlines (majority long haul) and the service I received on this flight going to Jeddah and flying back to London was excellent. Very friendly, helpful and professional.

2028,saudia_airlines,Good Economy Experience,"I have taken multiple trips on Saudi Airlines on many routes. in Business as well as Economy class. I have taken these flights on Domestic as well as International trips. This review cover the economy class review as everyone does a good job in Business and First class.There are a few things that I like about Saudi Airlines. They are always on time and some times before time. They have one of the best baggage allowance on the Economy tickets. They allow 2 bags of 23kgs on non US flights. This is the most generous among other leading carriers. Their economy seats are good enough for a tall person to take a comfortable 6-10 hours flights and not have any seat related fatigue. All of their big flights on International routes have a prayer area for Muslims to pray. This area is always located at the back of the aircraft, If you feel tired, you can go to this area and stretch your body and feel better.There are some things that Saudia can improve to be ranked better.The in-flight food is not good, this can be improved. The portions are very lean and they can improve the portion a bit. The ground service at the airport where the airline staff are appointed should be improved. The cabin crew needs huge makeover. Their uniforms are dull and don't represent the airline brand in the right way. They look very old and looks like the design and patterns are a century old. The cabin service can be better, their crew are attentive and many times rude. They misbehave with first time flyers who are intimidated with the airline seating and unable to locate their seat.On some of the domestic flights, I have experienced that the crew was not able to complete the meal service and half the passengers were served with in-flight meals and the remaining half were not as it was already time to land.Many times it has happened and I have seen this happen, if you call for a flight attendant, they ignore you and get busy in their own work. Many times you can hear the cabin crew laugh and talk very loudly. Many times the cabin crew has not bothered to check the seat belts during takeoff and landing. This only reflects the lackadaisical attitude of the cabin crew.The in-flight entertainment system is good, easy to navigate but the collection of movies and programs are limited, they should work on updating the choice of movies and programs, if not many, they should be latest, new and from around the world.Their flight tickets are always on the expensive side, There was a Guest supersaver and Business supersaver fare that used to exist till about a year back which does not exist any more. The supersaver is a nonrefundable extremely cheap fare. They should bring back this fare if they want to capture market share.Remember, Saudia is the national carrier of Saudi Airlines and they don't serve alcohol in their lounge nor on their flights.","July 24, 2016",4,Date of travel: July 2016,"Mumbai, India",4,2,3,3,4,2,2,3

The business class lounge was decent but not on the same level as other airlines I've flown. Hot buffet as well as hot and cold drinks are provided. No reclining couches or prayer facilities for men in the lounge. The plane that was used on my route was the 737-200. It had a total of 14 business class seats of which my family took 5. The plane is extremely old and in need of refurbishment. Seat layout is 2-3-2 and seat width is said to be 60cm however it felt cramped. Privacy screen was not working on some seats and entertainment system was glitchy. The seats do lay flat however they are extremely uncomfortable. Meals were mediocre and choices were few.

Well of course with Saudia we were booked in a cheap hotel in Male until further notice. With my history and experience with Saudia, I have booked a one way ticket on the same day (obviously a very expensive last minute one way for me and my wife) on Emirates (extremely ponctual and reliable) back to Riyadh. Let alone the difference in staff attitude and professionalism at the airport. People on my flight arrived more than 24 hours later to Riyadh (a 4 hour flight).

2048,saudia_airlines,Lack proper communication and customer service skills,"Saudi Airline Business class service was okay thanks to the welcoming hostess onboard. But the airport in Jeddah is the worst! worst airport I have been to in my life. I was travelling to Saudi Arabia on an umrah trip from Toronto to Medina via Jeddah. The flight was delayed in Toronto for nearly 2 hours. All passengers was already onboard the plane while it was investigating some security concern on a passenger onboard. Fair enough safety over anything!I had 2 hours connection at Jeddah airport for my next flight to Medina. More than the flight was delayed in Toronto, I missed the connecting flight to Medina. I have travelled to different countries around the world but my first time in Saudi Arabia. Once I got to Jeddah I already knew that I was going to miss the flight but I was more surprised by the attitude of the staff at the airport, wallahi they are the worst! It is understandable that they can't speak English properly but their attitude is the worst, neither do they have good customer service they are just plain rude and unprofessional. For any travelers travelling to Jeddah its good to know that there is no free or paid wifi at the airport, yes in 2016 they do not have wifi for international travelers! So I was told that I had to pay for another flight to Medina? I was like heck no, because it was not my fault that I miss the flight but the airline was delayed. They would not even try to understand. they send me back and forth to the 2nd floor (that's where they sell the ticket) and I am waiting in line for my turn to speak to an agent and there is this random man trying to bypass me. Trust me you need a lot of patience there, there is no such thing as manners there. 'Please' and 'thank you' just doesn't exist. It was 9:30 am in Jeddah and the next flight to Medina was at 3:30 pm. There was no way I was going to stay at that airport for 6 hours without wifi. I had a friend who was already waiting for me at Medina airport and it is so sad that I could not even let him know that I missed the flight as I had a Canadian sim card on my phone and there was no wifi at the airport, I asked the staff to borrow their phone to let my friend know that I missed the flight but the response was a plain 'no'. There was no paid phone call available inside the airport as well. At this point I just had enough. I took my passport, left the airport and took a taxi to Medina which is approximately 3 hours driving from Jeddah. My overall experience with Jeddah airport was just a nightmare. I have enough self respect to never fly by Jeddah again unless it is improved and it's a shame that they hire a lot of young and unprofessional staff who needs training about customer service. It's even more shameful that in 2016 they do not have free wifi at the airport. When I look back, it was a good learning experience for now I know better. I have to say not every person is bad but the majority of the staff is very unprofessional. If you are looking to go to Saudi for Umrah I would recommend avoid Jeddah airport. Alternatively, you can go to Medina via Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Istanbul. There are a lot of ways if you do your research well before travelling. Hope this helps!

2051,saudia_airlines,Worst experience,"COMPLAINTMy name is Makieh Aldalati, a USA citizen. I was booked on a business class seat flight number SV301 ( ETKT 065-2241247007) departing Jeddah airport on June 1, 2016 at 9:50 a.m arriving Cairo at 10:55 a.m.I checked-in at Jeddah airport at 8:15 a.m and then went to ""Al Fursan Lounge"". As the lounge was very crowded and in complete Chaos I asked a lounge staff member Mr. Ahmad Al-Sherif about my departure time. I was told that the flight was delayed until 10:00a.m; I later asked again and was told once more that the flight was delayed until 11:00 a.m. As normal protocol in Business/First Class Lounge, I waited until any staff member would inform us to board the plane but no did. After 20 minutes I grew restless and went to the lounge desk in order to ask about our boarding; and to my shocking surprise, I was told that the plane had taken off. I want to begin by simply informing you that I am a consistent Business/First class client and I have never been treated with such disrespect and negligence as I have been by your staff. I attempted to complain that no one informed us to board (as common practice) in business/first class lounges and one of the staff members responded to me and said ""they do not do that"" and told me""to go to the check-in counter in order to rearrange my booking "". I immediately called a friend who suggested that I call Mr. Mansour (Head Manager) and personally complain to him. After doing so, Mr. Mansour advised me to go back to Al Fursan Lounge and he would send someone to help me as soon as possible. Following my phone call with the Head Manager, Mr. Bandar showed up at the lounge and it was visibly apparent that his main priority was not to help me but to know how I got Mr. Mansour's Telephone number (as though it's a national security concern) . When I told Mr. Bandar what'd happened he shockingly replied ""ENOUGH"". - Do you want to hurt the Fursan Lounge Staff??.- I said no, but I want to have my preserved rights and a decent solution to my problem. Mr. Bandar sent a staff member with me (who consistently complained the entire time, that it's not his job to help me).He sent me to an office where there were a number of guys and one of them said to me: ""We do not have to take your hand to board the plane !!!Ultimately disregarding that it was the lounge staff obligation to announce to First/Business class passengers that it was time for them to go and board the plane.This man told me that I had to buy a new ticket and can't just pay penalty fee though it was not my fault by any standard . I proceeded to the ticketing counter where I was told that there is no availability in business class and that I had to travel in economy class. I bought a ""one way"" economy class ticket (ETKT 065-2472316817) at SR 2200 (L.E 6394), while I originally bought a return business class ticket at approximately LE 5900. It is of normal practice that the airline staffers arrange the transfer of baggage to new flights. However, In my case I was told that I have to go to the Southern terminal in order to bring my luggage in person. (I found this to be a very abnormal procedure). The person who was sent with me by Mr. Bandar, said it was not his job to take me there. He sent a porter with me and brought my luggage back. During check in the staff member at the counter wanted me to pay for my excess baggage. I told him that I 'd done that upon my first check in and even showed him the receipt of payment (SR 618). Nevertheless, he refused to accept it claiming the computer did not accept that, AND ONLY After lengthy arguments he checked me in with my luggage.The person assigned to me by Mr Bandar told me that I can wait at the Fursan Lounge. Finally when I went there Mr. Fadi Sambawa (at the Fursan Lounge counter) looked at my new boarding pass he politely and courteously told me that I cannot stay in the lounge. However, after showing him my previous business boarding pass and telling him what'd happened, he gracefully allowed me into the lounge.I would have hoped all the staff were as helpful and well-mannered as Mr. Sambawa. Respectful airline staff should always conduct themselves with their passengers.Now, SV313 flight was scheduled to take off at 5:00p.m but was delayed to 8:45p.m and I received a message via my Saudi mobile confirming this delay. Shortly after the first call to board the flight a lounge staff member told passengers to go and board the plane. Still after boarding the plane it did not take off until about 10:30p.m. I arrived Cairo airport at 11:25p.m ; i.e., 12.25 Saudi time meaning that my trip from Jeddah to Cairo took me 15 hours 15 minutes.I have to say that I was extremely shocked by the despondent efficiency of Saudi Airlines and the unethical behavior of their ground staff with trying to evade responsibility by blaming their passengers to cover for their own failures. I felt I was discriminated for being a) a woman , and, b) for being American (a foreigner). I was treated as somebody who has no rights whatsoever .I am sure if I were travelling with Emirates Airlines or any other responsible Airline I would have received much better service and attention especially as a business class passenger . Frankly, after what I experienced with Saudia personnel I would never recommend to any of my VIP friends to fly with Saudia Airline nor would I expect anything positive to come out of my complaint if ever, that is if an investigation will ever take place.What disappoints me most is that I have always had high regard to Saudi Airlines, apparently unjustifiably, which diminished with the first problem I encountered while travelling with Saudia. I did not receive any decent and fair treatment by any of the Saudia Staff with the exception of Mr Fadi Sambawa who is an example of how an airline staff should be.","June 8, 2016",1,Date of travel: June 2016,,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

2066,saudia_airlines,A nightmarish flight!,"Saudi Airlines.Traveling from New York to Islamabad with my children aged 9 and 10 on a Saudi Airlines flight following was my observation:** Overall flight was okay from New York to Jeddah but from Jeddah to Islamabad and Islamabad to Riyadh and back to New York was unforgivable. It was for second class citizens.* I requested diabetic meals for myself. Got all regular meals including extremely rich desserts and fruits and breads except for the ‘diabetic meal’ sticker! I know what diabetic meal is supposed to be.* I requested kids’ meal for my children. We got cold, chilled fried food for them (I wished I had requested regular meals.) Both kids got terribly sick. My son was throwing up in the shuttle bus at the Jeddah airport and in the airport. Security staff helped. Kids were sick for the following 4-5 days in Islamabad when our total trip was for 14 days! Thanks, Saudi Airlines!* From Jeddah to Islamabad the flight was worse. Seats were dirty. I mean real dirty. Dirt settled in the crevices. Dust all over the curves of the seats. * Toilets painted a filthy picture! No toiletries! Grime was seen all over. First I thought it was paint; then I took toilet paper and rubbed over one of the several lines of grime along the joints of panels, paper became black! I haven’t seen a filthy aircraft like this.* Cabin crew had an attitude incomparable. * I had ice in a small plastic bag to keep my Insulin cool. I asked the hostess to kindly refrigerate my Insulin. “No we have a lot of items in the refrigerator but I’ll give you ice.” My Insulin was 1” x 2” in measurement! And it was in a box. The hostess asked senior hostess if she could give some ice. This senior lady, an oriental looking lady gave me a dirty look and I went back to my seat. The hostess brought some ice in a ‘Sickness bag’ without my plastic bag so the ice melted and the bag broke! She tossed out my small bag for ice. * On our return we had over 8 hrs of layover at Riyadh airport. No hotel room was provided. I know by law an airline is supposed to provide a room if the lay over is 8 hrs or more. This was the worst part of the flight!* With over 8 hrs. to spend with small children at the airport, not even a bench was provided for the travelers to stretch their backs! The chairs provided are with fixed armrests so you don’t lie down. Punishment for flying Saudia! How badly my kids wanted to lie down I can’t explain. Eight hours of unrest and then 13 hours and 20 minutes flight? We had flown from Pakistan. We were in travel for 6-7 hours already. One can see millions of dollars spent on beautification of the airport but not a single recliner or a rest area provided.* Instead of hotel room they gave us dinner, but how? We were handed boxes of dinner in our hands! We had to sit on those seats, putting the boxes in our laps and fumble with them making our clothes and hands and chairs dirty. How cheap could an airline get? What a sad picture!

Fortunately, my mother had a pant in her carried luggage, but it was a real hassle to get changed at the airport.3- Jeddah's airport is far from the international standards and there is no comparison with Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 4- One luggage was lost in Jeddah and we were told that it got sent to Hong Kong. Saudi ground staffs never updated us, we had to call every day, speaking to different employees who could not care less about our luggage. We had to buy clothes to spend decent holidays and the luggage was finally sent to Manila 3 days later. We had to send someone to pick it up. The ground staff did not require an ID to collect the luggage and they never gave any receipt which our insurance require for claiming. Even after emailing the country manager, never gave us any receipt nor any apology. 5- For the return flight, I finally obtained from the country manager, to upgrade. Indeed he did, but only up to Saudi. From Saudi to Paris, my parents were so squeezed in economy class with poor service, my father fainted and had to receive a medical emergency in Paris airport. The staffs at the airport had to face poor cooperation with the airline staff and my parents were told that this is typical behaviour from this airline company.

The plane is a B777-300 so noise inside the cabin is quite low compared to other planes. Cabin crew isn't the best, but not the worst. Food was average. Be aware of the cultural difference! Before landing in Jeddah to drop passengers, most men changed their clothe into a white robe. Moments before landing, one old gentleman went close to a door and started praying and singing, very loud, and the rest of the passengers joined the praying and singing, which got me scared but later I was told my the very old Saudi woman next to me that it's normal.

The woman in the next seat kept all the stuff the air hostess gave - AH would give her 3 of, say sweets, cool drinks etc. so that she could pass it on to the other 2 passengers (this woman was in the aisle seat) and put it into her bag. Whereafter I would have to summon the AH to get my share. The AH's appear to be non-Saudis and seem to be in a state of terror vis-a-vis the Saudi passengers.
